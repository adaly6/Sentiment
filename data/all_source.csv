It's now an ordeal getting the refund for items that were received by them three weeks ago.

"Anonymous","They don't even deserve one star. Ordered a rugby shirt, sent a football one.  Contacted chat, had to speak to several people to get it sorted because I didn't respond to them within 2 minutes so they cut me off.  Please not I was hold ages, and wasn't sure when they would come back, so I grabbed a drink!!! anyways They told me I had to return the shirt but not to worry they would send me a voucher for this so it would be free, but that I had to do this within 48hr. or I would have to pay.  Um who's mistake was this and   I am sorry but I work and this is not convenient. I will return as soon as I can and it will still be free. Eventually they agreed to send a new shirt. Sadly they did exactly the same again sent me the exact same wrong shirt and its even says its the wrong shirt on the label someone has written it on there but they sent it anyways, who does that!!!   Today I contacted again, very rude rep, unhelpful, wouldn't give me any details told me to complain to customer services, but wouldn't give me the email and then just stopped responding but didn't leave the chat.  I waited ages.  Eventually spoke to another rep who agreed to process for a refund, of course he can't do that though and it has to go to the back office, so who knows when I will hear from them and get a refund!!

I have spent a total of one hour trying to get this straightened out.  Both agents assured me I would get the Seminole pumpkins by October 27th.  It is now October 30th and no pumpkin signs or email confirmation.  My son also previously ordered FSU clothing and he finally received it after the game.  They said they would send it overnight  on game day and this never happened.  We both agree that customer service gives you different stories.Well... I received my order today and once again it is WRONG!  Fanatics sent me the same pumpkin signs with the letters ""FSU"" on them and not the Seminole Indian.  I called customer service for the THIRD time and they said they were ""glad to send a return label and I was not responsible for shipping.""  They also send they would refund me and I got a confirmation that the refund was for $4.99 (the shipping) and not the full $44.00+ that I paid.  They also said if I reordered the signs they would give me 30% off.  No thanks when they couldn't get it right after two tries and Halloween is tomorrow.

Of course they have no idea where it's at and of course now that jersey is not available. What a cluster F of a company.

So figuring I will return it; I see must have tags and be in new unworn condition.  What the hell kind of return policy is that?  Who returns an item in unworn condition unless it is too large or small or whatever?  What if it is JUNK?  Tried to chat with the chat function, does not work.  At this point will just probably keep it and take the hit.  What a crap return policy.  I am sticking with Amazon going forward at least there I can return something when it is not going to work.  Very disappointed in the product and the company.UPDATE NOVEMBER 3, 2023:  Fanatics did reach out  to me and promptly issued me a return label and took the item back and refunded my purchase price and shipping in full.  So, very pleased with them for doing so.  Just wish it was a little easier to return defective items that you have worn.

"Chris","Ordered a Jersey and the day it was supposed to deliver I checked the tracking and it said that the address was incomplete and they could not deliver. I checked on Fanatics and they DID have my correct and complete address, but I sent it to the carrier anyway, just in case. The following day it says the package was delivered even though it never came and I waited for it ALL day they said it was delivered and signed for by ME???!!! That was a blatant lie. The package never came to my home and the ""signature"" they showed me said ""DNS"". I don't even know what DNS is, but it is not my signature. Fanatics did credit me and offered me a 30% off coupon which I apperciate. In the end, my feeling is this was an issue with OnTrac, the carrier that they use and not Fanatics themselves. Something was definitely shady with that carrier.Edit: Just tried to use the 30% off code given to me by Fanatics for my trouble and it is no more that the normal 30% off given for anyone's order. It is not in addition to their normal price, so basically useless. I found another vendor to purchase from. Keep your code. Back to ONE STAR!",2023-10-25,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

On September 26 it still had not shipped, so I reached out to customer service and was told it would ship that day, and some sort of “ticket” would be created to sometime higher up in CS to reach out. Never head back and my order never shipped. Reached out to CS again on October 2, and it took 30 (!) minutes for sometime to respond on chat. Was PROMISED up and down my order would ship on October 3. Then on October 4 received an email that the order no longer has a ship date or estimated arrival.

I proceeded to cancel the rest of the  order which has not even left the wear house and was told I could not cancel. I am beyond frustrated no one will be here to get the order and I was never told when ordering that the merchandise was not available instead I was told it would be at my home within 10 days. I want my order cancelled and my money refunded. I am very sad to say I will not order again. And I order lots for gifts for my extended family over seas.

"Dee","Had shipping issues with this company in the past, but this is the worst. I will never purchase from this company again… buyer beware. I placed an order on 9/28. Got an email a few days ago it was delayed. I contacted the company to cancel the order because I have to go out of town and will not be home at this point to receive the package because it’s taking so long. It has now been 12 days since I ordered and they are saying they cannot cancel due to “technical issues”. I don’t have anyone to pick up the package while I’m gone and ordered in plenty of time before I planned to leave. That isn’t my problem it’s their problem they didn’t warn customers they had a delay in shipping. The fact that I have to fight to cancel an order that hasn’t even been processed yet is insane. Until I saw other reviews, I finally also realized the quality of some of the items I have received in the past were garbage. I thought this was officially licensed clothing??

When it arrived, the letters were peeling off the jersey straight out of the package. We initiated a return, and they promised to send a replacement. When the new package arrived, it was clearly someone else's order - a Blue Jays jerseys with a different name. So we initiated a return again, and asked for the right order to be sent. Instead, Fanatics sent a 30% off coupon for our next purchase, and refunded a portion of our money. Only after complaining to customer service were we given the full refund. In the end they made no attempt to fulfill our order. I've never had such a frustrating online purchasing experience in my life. Their final attempt to appease was another discount coupon code.

I have changed to 4 stars because they contacted me back and resolved my issue by offering to send the correct size and advising I could keep the one sent in error because the returns link wasn't able to offer a satisfactory way of returning the item. I think they have done the fair a right thing in resolving it in the way they have. I wanted to give 4.5 stars because 5 stars should be for outstanding service with no issues but because they resolved it in the way they have offered to I thought it only fair to round it up to 5 stars rather then round it down to 4 stars.. If your going to complain I feel it's only right to give a company positive feedback when they resolve the issue. If your a customer reading the reviews I wouldn't be put off by the rating they have got. Overall because in my experience they have acted in the correct manner once it's been escalated to the right person. Like any business including my own there are mistakes that happen and if they do the right thing it's important to put the record straight. I will use this business again I'm just hoping they fulfill there offer and if they don't I will I write another review that will reflect my experience.

I then found out they the 3rd party courier has given it to another 3rd party courier who doesn’t even have a branch in my state which means it will be given to another 3rd party courier.

READ ALL REVIEWS, FROM ANY SITE, BEFORE YOU ORDER. Due to ALL of the 1 star reviews from this site, I will not order thru them. Read the reviews people have posted about this site.

Wanted to get Columbia fsu gear as the season started but the sizes on Columbias brand are a bit too big and I wasn’t aware. Asked to see if I can exchange and they don’t do that… How can an online apparel store not offer size exchanges?

I usually buy stuff from a different NFL fans site, I regret using fanatics and won’t ever use them again and do not recommend them.EDIT - the email referred to in their response below basically just said “we’re sorry you didn’t receive your package please allow up to 5 days for refund to process”.

I argued with customer ""service"" - the woman was very nice and seemed to feel badly about their error, so she refunded part of the $9.95 fee, saying ""I'm so sorry, there's nothing else I can do.""This company isn't managing inventory properly if a huge article of clothing is labelled in a vastly different size, and they seem determined to make some sort of profit when they're not ""out"" any inventory, sticking customers with small fees for THEIR ERRORS.

If I email I get this is not a monitored email address and their online customer service enquiry service is just a computer that says it doesn't understand my question about undelivered items! I wish RFU, NFL, NHL move away from this supplier who may be cheap for them but are terrible partners.

These people are absolutely TERRIBLE. Avoid this company at all costs.As you will see below, they invite you to contact customer service when you share your terrible experience. The thing is customer service IS the problem. They won’t exchange sizes as a matter of policy. Why would I try contacting them again?While the offers of assistance keep coming after hanging up on me, the bottom line is they will not exchange sizes. Customer service reps won’t put a supervisor on the phone. I asked repeatedly before I was hung up on for someone to help with a resolution to simply change the size.I did correspond with customer service by email just to see what they would do to ""get me back in the game."" The answer is nothing. If you get the wrong size, your only option is to return them for refund. Guess what? You can then buy more if you want to try another size. In a gift setting, this is absurd.If I have a return refunded to the person giving the gift and then order new goods (1) that embarrasses the gift giver for (a) not knowing my size and (b) knowing that their gift expenses have been refunded due to return and (2) results in ME buying those gifts. For Fanatics to call that a ""return"" policy is both disingenuous and fraudulent. They effectively have a REFUND policy with the option to buy more of your stuff, NOT an exchange policy.I sent the shirts back and do not want a replacement.

"Alison","I have always loved Fanatics. My husband and I have used them many times to purchase items for our children. I had an extremely disappointing experience this past week regarding shipping and the lack of help and understanding I received regarding the issue.I placed an order for a jersey and headband on Th (10/19) for my son to wear in his school Halloween parade on F (10/27). I had looked several times for this particular jersey, which had been out of stock, and was delighted to find it was back in stock and had a coupon code attached.I went through the checkout process and was given the 3-7 business days as the default shipping selection. If I would have selected this option, I would have been taking a chance on the arrival date (it may have been here and it may not have been). Instead, I opted for the 5 business day shipping option. Since I placed the order on Thursday, one would assume Th is a wash and the business day count would begin on Friday (10/20) which would mean the kit would arrive on or by TH (10/26). Perfect for my needs.On Friday (10/20), I received a shipment notification saying that my order would arrive on Friday (10/27). I contacted costumer service since this delivery date would do me absolutely no good and I had paid extra a 5 business day shipping option. They told me that the 5 days does not begin until the item actually ships. What?!?! I have never heard of anything like this in my life. They said because on the page I ordered from it said the jersey ""will ship between 1-2 business days"" I should have taken these days into account. This is absolutely absurd and NO WHERE did it say I needed to do this. I assumed when I checked the upgraded box my item would arrive within 5 business days as promised.Because the item had shipped they could not choose a different delivery option for me (which makes complete sense). I asked if they could ship me the same items with an earlier arrival date and I would ship back the original order when it arrived. No go. I talked to 2 different people and no one could make this happen.I told the person I would be happy to place an additional order if I could get the return label/restocking fee waived and if I could get the better discount code I used the day prior. I also asked if there was anything they could do to waive part of the new shipping costs since Fanatics made a mistake. I did get the free return label but the best they could do was the discount code available that day (which was not as good) and I would have to pay new delivery fees.This was very disappointing to me because Fanatics screwed up with their shipping options. It was very misleading and false to say an item would arrive in 5 business days and then have it arrive 1 day later (when it is no longer needed).I asked the person what shipping option they suggested I choose this time around as I need the jersey by TH. They suggested I choose ""overnight delivery"" because the jersey would not ship out until W (10/25) and this would allow me to have it on Th (10/26). Again, what!?!? Overnight means overnight. I placed the order on Friday (again, I would not assume it would go out on Friday afternoon). I would assume it would go out on Monday and arrive on Tuesday (that is overnight!).So I paid the overnight delivery fee and got a notice today that my order will arrive on Tuesday. Completely wrong information was given on Friday.I spend 1.5 hours on Friday afternoon dealing with two different customer service agents. At the end of it all:My son will have his costume BUT- I will have to go to the trouble of returning an order.- I paid an overnight fee that did not need to be paid in addition to the extra money I had already paid to have the items shipped within 5 business days.-I paid more because no one was able to give me the original discount code I had used for the purchase.This is all totally ridiculous and I am appalled at the lack of knowledge of the customer service agents and the inability to ""right a wrong"" that was on the company. They told me they were doing me a favor by waiving the restocking fee and that was the best they could do.UPDATE: Fanatics reached out to me next day and completely resolved the issue. Gave me a free return label, the original coupon code and a refund for the expedited shipping. Very prompt and satisfactory response!",2023-09-02,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Leigh Brown","Purchased a football shirt with customisation on 4th September and paid for next business day delivery as it was a birthday present.  An email I received gave an estimated delivery of 15th September? When I queried it, I was advised that it would take longer due to customisation.  I’m not sure why they offered next business day delivery if they knew from start they couldn’t fulfil that promise.  Spoke to someone on the 14th as the order was showing still as “processing” and impossible to get to me by the 15th and they agreed to refund my delivery charges.  It’s now 16th, no signs of the jersey and still showing as “processing”.  How hard can it be to take a jersey off a shelf, print the customisation and then post it?  Since the point of purchase I could have walked from my house to the actual club shop (3 days) got the shirt and walked back with days to spare to sort my blisters out!**EDIT**Thanks for your response and partial refund which I don’t think is anywhere near good enough.  Anyway, more than a refund I’d just like the item I paid for, or even a delivery date.  From speaking to one of your CS agents I was advised “I'm afraid this delay has been caused after relocating our warehouse operation, though we assure you that we are working with all departments to get this order shipped as soon as possible.”. I cannot even get an estimated date of delivery!  If you can’t fulfil orders, why the hell have  you continued taking them?  Sort your backlog out first!",2023-08-18,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Customer","Completely faceless service, so NOBODY has any responsibility/accountability/cares.Your item will arrive with no paperwork, no contact details or even a return slip. You have to trawl through the website to find anything & if you try the chat service there is never anyone on the other end available. It all feels very deliberate. It's accept or return your item, at considerable cost, there's no in-between & defiantly no customer service.This stuff isn't cheap, so I'll think carefully before buying again.I ordered a polo top & it was pictured and described  'Dark Blue', what came was 'Deep Dive', 'teal' to you and me. Nice top, but not as advertised/ordered. I sent a polite note to the customer service email, asking if I'd been sent the wrong item, or it's incorrectly advertised. (there is no green coloured top on the website, only dark blue) As I would only return it, for a replacement, not to go without a top at all to start the new season. I got a generic reply telling me to start the return process (ow the last time I did that, I had to check my bank account a few weeks later to find out what happened, as they don't inform you whats happening).Terrible, terrible service, inflated prices, handling fees & excessing shipping costs.AVFC, are these the people you want representing the Club????",2023-08-30,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Robert Gale","First off, if i could give them “0” stars for customer service, I surely would.  I will never make another purchase from this website and here is why.  We purchased monogrammed sweat pants in Medium to give as a gift for our grandson.  They turned out to be too small and he wanted an exchange but they had no large size and he requested a credit.  After the application of $10 of “fan cash” from our account, we ended up paying a total including shipping of $46.xx.  The so called “fan cash” was not redeposited into our account and we received an e-credit of only $38.xx and worst of all they sent us the e-credit rather than the recipient of the gift.  Every other retailer I know would have given a credit to the person who applied for the refund.  We will also contact the University who licenses the use of their logo to FANATICS and let them know what a disappointing company is allowed to use their logos. ADDENDUM:  I did get a reply to my review but frankly it required me to do more work.  Too little, too late.  I am going to just accept my losses, make it right with my grandson and as I have stated previously, “never do business with FANATYICS.COM again.",2023-08-08,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Craig","My experience with fanatics has been a poor one. This is based on not just one order, but several I have placed over the last year though their company (all my orders through the England Store)I only ever give positive feedback historically, but 3 times this year I have had the same problem with Fanatics. I get the impression that Fanatics is a company that deals with a high volume of orders, and they cannot cope with the demand pure and simple. The customer experience when placing an order online should be very straight forward. You place an order and the item is generally shipped within 2-3 working days. From a company such as Fanatics you would expect all orders to be dealt with quickly and efficiently, and not have to wait several weeks for orders. I have ordered 3 England shirts at various times this year, and on each occasion the shirts were late by at least 2-3 weeks. I have a current order being processed which has so far taken 10 working days. It is my understanding that shirts ordered with personalisation would take longer, which is fine, but it does not take 10 working days to pick a shirt off a shelf and then personalise it! A reasonable turn around time for a personalised shirt should be 3-4 working days maximum. It is a fact that 41% of online shoppers expect their orders within 24 hours, so you can understand why a company like Fanatics receive so many poor reviews. I can imagine that a very high percentage of their orders are processed well outside of 24hrs. I have read other poor reviews regarding Fanatics, and I can see that as an organisation they do respond when poor feedback is given. This is good, however, it should not be the responsibility of Customer Service Advisors to apologise for poor service!, when clearly changes need to be made to speed processes up. Please also note that I have sent three separate emails to their Customer Services team to raise my concerns, within the space of two weeks, all of which have all gone unanswered. This could be of course because they receive a high volume of complaints, which is to be expected if customers are having to wait 3-4 weeks, or longer for orders to be processed.While I do appreciate that orders take time, unfortunately customer time is precious, and Customers should not be expected to wait long periods for orders without even an update, or an explanation why the order is late. Fanatics as an organisation needs to vastly improve their service if they want more than a 1 star review. They need to be more forthcoming with updates on orders, and reasons for delays. If a turn around time of 2-3 working days is not achievable for orders, then they are simply not good enough to manage orders placed though the England site. No matter what you are selling, you can never please every Customer, fact. But surely after reading all these poor reviews you can at least improve your service vastly, or you will not last very long as an organisation. The consumer will soon get tired of this, and will not likely order from you again. In future customers may resort to actually going to a store, and having a shirt personalised on the day, which in all honesty makes sense now!Now been 20 working days since placing my order. Fanatics offered a 25% off discount code, but what I want it what I actually ordered a month ago. It is obvious that they never had the stock in the first place.

"Mark Mc","26/08/23 Ordered AM top from them and it never showed up. Sent another they say, but again nothing and now waiting my refund. Never left a bad review in my life, but this ""chat"" service they offer is so poor and it shows the poor level of customer service they offer. Just cannot believe they are that big, that a bit of customer service, did not make sure this top did turn up for me. Missed my mates birthday now, so thanks for not caring...24/09 : Another week has gone by and still no refund, just not good enough. Get something wrong, then fix it…….and if you still don’t fix it and you offer refund, then do it and stop messing things up more.Still no goods or refund, but message from a Jordan to rectify things I believe. Reply from Fanatics18 Sep 2023Good afternoon, Mark. We are truly sorry for your experience and would like to make this right. Please reach out via email at customerfirst with the order details so we can review this further. Thank you, Jordan.Well Jordan, if you can just sort my refund please, as finished with promises and will not be buying here again…Oct 1st updateRefund is to be given, but only when top received back that they know I have never received and it will take between 2-7 days. Still waiting 5th Oct. Still very very poor customer service I would say. Fanatics- Thankyou for reaching us! I am really sorry that you need to experience this, upon checking with your order details the refund was already been processed since 1st of October please be advised that the refund would reflect in your account within 2-7 business days. I remain optimistic a refund will happen, but would never use again as nearly 6 weeks of me chasing, there hasn’t been any closure.Well as of 10th Oct, still no refund and dispute with bank has now started, as they are embarrassing themselves in not closing this matter and allowing this to continue when they are at fault. Funny thing is, there customer service email is customersfirst@, which is definitely not the case...12/10 Finally refunded today, there is closure (Hooray !!). Just a shame you didn’t put your hands up and put things right quicker, it has been me doing all the chasing. 26/08 till today, very disappointing…",2023-07-31,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

I don't go out of my way to write negative reviews but I could not let this go.I ordered an Everton away top and paid extra for next business day delivery. They took the order 3 times out of my bank and sent me 3 order numbers. I tried the chat bot and there's never anyone there to chat to. It says they'll ""be right back"". I tried calling and the automated response does not read what you're saying. When you eventually get to speak with staff they are rude and arrogant. First I was told that it was my mistake and they have no order numbers correlating to the ones I have so I need to go to my bank. This was an attempt to palm me off. I screen shot the emails and the bank statement and sent that to them.i was told order have been void but they could not tell me how long a refund would take. Literally no apology no ""sorry for incknvenience"" nothing. I finally got an email address from here and got a response to say that money will be paid back by 4th aug and if not received to contact them again. I will wait to see what happens but I have no faith. Everton need to stop using this appalling company. They're unreliable, untrustworthy and downright rude.

I bought these items as gifts for a special birthday….. and despite calling their customer service number,  e mailing 2 customer service e mail addresses and using their online chat…. All if which automated and quite useless. I feel let down and wont have my presents in time for my friends special birthday. Previous orders from fanatics havent been an issue, this one however…. The most important one is a major let down and just left feeling a bit gutted. Fanatics… please have actual humans to help myself and all these other people who are spending their hard earned money on your goods, so much negative customer service reviews…. Please do something about it, please!!Update 31/8/23 , so i cancelled my order as fanatic still couldn't give me a new delivery date. It seems that the only way to get a response from a human is to leave a review on here. I was told my refund was released by them yesterday and to allow 3-7 working days for me to get it back. Lets hope their refund timescale is a lot better than their shipping one!! Will update again when funds have reached my account.  This is my 4th order with fanatics, the first 3 were perfect, this order has been a nightmare however and their lack of customer service and everything being automated is not helpful at all. My advice to anyone reading these reviews is to avoid them and if you follow a sports team or want some sporting merch, go the club/team directly.Update 2/9/23, my refund is back into my account, so fair play fanatics for a swift conclusion! Still gutted i have had to do without my order and severe lack of customer service. Like i posted previously the only way to get an answer is to leave a review.  using their phone number, e mail addresses and online help chat will get you absolutely nowhere!!

The hoodie was clearly defective as it was a plain hoodie, the images/prints were not on it! The other item was fine to be fair.

Each time I tried to use their chat system I received a message telling me they were too busy etc.. why have such a system if it is useless? Why not answer customer‘s emails?? Is it seen as acceptable to send out defective goods and then hope the customer gets sick and tired of trying to communicate with your non existent staff? Shocking service.

So the issue I had was that my item wasn't delivered on the time stated, & like a few on here I was struggling to find an email or phone No to contact on their site, Their live chat was about as much use as an ashtray on a motorbike. . . but I found the email on trust pilot on a response from Fanatics to a disgruntled customer, So i emailed them & got an instant response that they'd received my email & would be in contact shortly . . . 8 hours later I got a reply saying that it must have got lost in transit & offered me a refund or replacement, So i thought i'd give them a 2nd chance at sending me what I'd ordered, A few hours later they send an email to say they'd sent it out again & i should expect delivery on the 17th of July, I've checked the order everyday & it just says it's been shipped . . . then low & behold it was delivered today . . .4 days early!!! So thankfully I haven't got to give them a 1 star review!!",2023-07-13,3,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Tim Morris","I recently purchased a polo shirt the “official F1” website. After the product was received, I emailed customer service to express my dissatisfaction with the quality/size of the polo shirt. As I am muscular man, I ordered an XXL shirt. The shirt I received was sized in what appears to be a men’s medium. The shirt is in no way reflective of an XXL. I have emailed customer service three times to resolve this matter.  When I tried using the return link,  I was flabbergasted with the process. My original order was $74.26. Yet, the refund was noted at $58.10. In addition, the mailing fees to return the shirt were of $23.10.  It should not be the customers responsibility to pay for postage to return a defective product. The first  “customer service” representative advised there was nothing she could do except send me a 30% coupon. I asked her why I would want to buy another article of clothing when the one I just bought was of such poor quality and the sizing was inaccurate. I asked to speak with a supervisor only to be told she was the only person available to speak to me.At this point, it is not about the money. It IS about to incredibly poor customer service. As I was exploring the compliant process, I was shocked to learn that F1 Fanatics has a customer rating of 2.3 out of 5. Clearly, the type of my complaint, namely horrible customer service, seems to be a reoccurring theme. As a longtime Mercedes Benz owner and MBF1 fan, I am incredibly disappointed with the experience received from an authorized F1 vendor. I am confident that F1 and Mercedes Benz would not be satisfied with a partnering organization reflecting so poorly on the rightfully earned good name of both organizations.",2023-07-09,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Greg Price","If you are wanting F1 merchandise don't bother using Fanatics. Your order will be delayed or even canceled at the last minute. You are best going to other authorised resellers and paying the extra money for better service. This has happened on more than one occasion and I spoke to Customer Service to discuss better compensation before I posted this review, only 30% was offered when currency the website is offering 20% to 25% off anyway.Following a message on TrustPilot that they are going to contact me, I will amend the review once I receive the email",2023-07-07,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Gunnar Johildarson","Oh, where do I even begin? How about with a word to the wise? If you value your time, your hard-earned money, or the simple concept of decent customer service, then my advice is to steer well clear of Fanatics.com! I ventured onto their site with high hopes and great expectations. My innocent son, an avid Manchester United fan, was excited beyond measure for the new 23/24 kit. I could practically hear his gleeful cheers as I added the Rashford number 10 kit to our cart. Oh, but we didn't stop there! We even decided to add the Premier League's ""No Racism"" badge, hoping to proudly support the beautiful game's stand against hate. We placed our order, our hearts brimming with anticipation, and guess what? The kit arrived, all right. It was promptly shipped, quickly enough to maintain the illusion of competence. But lo and behold, the ""No Racism"" badge was MIA, gone without a trace, absent without leave. Our disappointment was as palpable as the metaphorical slap to the face Fanatic.com served us.Naturally, I tried to contact their customer service. Six days ago, four days ago, again today! If you're wondering, I am considering writing another message tomorrow. Alas, their response has been silence, loud and obnoxious. It's like sending a desperate message in a bottle into an ocean of indifference. So, here we are, stuck with an incomplete kit, and a sense of betrayal that no football fan should ever have to experience. Fanatics.com, they'll grab your money faster than a top striker nets a goal, but good luck getting them to acknowledge a problem with your order! It's like trying to hold a conversation with a brick wall, only less rewarding because at least a wall doesn't pretend to offer customer support.So, do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere. As for us, we'll stick to the good old physical stores next time. And Fanatics.com? If you happen to stumble upon this review during your apparent 24/7 break, know this – even a Manchester United 1 - Liverpool 6 defeat feels less frustrating than dealing with your 'customer service'. You’ve earned this one star, bask in its lonely, lackluster glow. Until the next message (that you'll probably ignore), An Ironic and Frustrated Customer.",2023-07-06,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Dionica Villarino","Ordered 4 shirts 6/1 with FREE NEXT DAY delivery. I check tracking that evening & it says label made but items not received by seller. First red flag. Reach out to Fanatics mid day 6/2 because status still same. I'm assured by Fanatics agent that tracking is wrong & the items are in transit. Second red flag. Sun starts to set, I check status & still says items not received by seller. Contact Fanatics again. This time I'm told I need to give them until Monday. Excuse me?  I need to do what? (I took screenshots). So, I ask why Monday. How do we go from next day to FOUR days? Because, check this out, they don't deliver on weekends. NOWHERE does it say that and at no time was I advised deliveries aren't made on weekends. Third red flag. Now, 2 days later tracking still says items have not been received. I contact Fanatics and the rep has the audacity to tell me my items were shipped.  When I provided the rep with the tracking details she literally stuttered. Caught her in a lie! She then proceeds to offer me a 30% coupon. Is that a joke? Why would I want to buy more items from a company that lies & practices fraudulent sale tactics? Plus, they are constantly running sales so the coupon is obsolete majority of the time. It's a scam to make you feel they care yet it's all so you spend more money. Consumer still loses & they win. I check BBB & it's littered with complaints about their poor delivery service & scams. I come here and what a shock (sarcasm) it's full of delivery complaints. Had I checked this site first I would have never made a purchase. If you are reading this I'd advise you to purchase from a more reputable company, even if it costs more. If you already made your purchase, and find yourself in a similar situation, get a refund immediately. Stop the purchase if you can. Contact your CC company & advise items were not delivered as promised and you dont have the items. In a round about way, this is theft! Whatever it takes. Do not give them a penny of your hard earned money. They clearly have no respect for their customers. And if a fanatics rep is reading this, please don't waste my time responding w a generic ""we care, please contact us"" message.

What a joke this company is. I did email Fanatics and they did not make it right as they told me the same thing that the Jersey Assurance does not cover when a player changes their number but they have not switched teams. After emailing them again and telling them that I would like a full refund and that the only way to make it right was to waive the $9.99 shipping fee, they did agree to that.

There were no indications the items were not available at the time when it would have been possible to go out to a sporting goods store that re-opened for the day after the win and purchase items that were in-stock. But being disabled I thought it would be easier to order from these folks and get overnight delivery. I went to track my order and discovered that the estimate was I might receive it by June 5th which I think is when game 3 of the finals is being played. I contacted customer service via chat and they told me there was a positive possibility it could be to them by June 2nd. To me any possibility from 0.1% to 100% is a positive possibility. The excuse they gave was they had not yet received it from the supplier. So sporting gods stores were able to have it for sale and you would receive the actual items but these folks were selling it and misleading customers about their availability and charging a premium for overnight that means once they receive it they will try to get it to you.

I applied the code, it accepted it, and it's still charging me $4.99 shipping. Just wait until they go bankrupt to buy your sports gear.",2023-05-18,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"PKFitz","I would like to edit and update this original 1 star review to a 4 star based off of the wonderful experience after this review. I would give a 5 star except it should have never gotten to the point of us having to go through so much to get any help. With that being said…Fanatics made everything right and we are very happy and will continue to be a customer and hope for a better experience always. We ordered a personalized jersey for a friend’s retirement.. we received a jersey with random letters and the #1 , not at all what we ordered. I immediately contacted Fanatics and was told pretty much too bad for me that is what I ordered. I told them that it is absolutely not what we ordered and their site must have a glitch on the personalization. I was originally told that they were making a case number and I would receive a return label. It never came so I contacted them again and had a horribly rude customer service experience who told us too bad. These jerseys are $149!! This was a retirement gift that is completely unuseable and makes no sense!! We did everything right and we have no one helping us make this right. Terrible customer service and we are long time customers.",2023-05-16,4,"Trust Pilot",NA

Not great and I won't be using them again.Replying to your response - please advise what I’d achieve from emailing your customer service desk?

"Visualizing Moments Owner","Scam Warning: This company is a scam committing fraud with peoples credit card, lets start from the begining..Author of this review has over 15 years experience in retail, customer service, call centers, and sales!1. Order was placed on the Fanatics website in which billionair Michael G. Rubin owns. 2. Customers money was taken from the credit/debit card immediately3. A couple of hours later customer received two different emails, the first email customer receives states that the customer canceled out his own order, the second email claims customer needs to verify credit/debit information with a department called the scam department. 4. Customer calls in to this department only to find out the the department who calls itself the scam department is the ones who are trying to run the scam.5. Customer now is being told to replace the order by the scam department, customer says that they have already taken the money off of the card, therefore he is not going to be placing another order for 110.18 especially since the first 110.18 has not been put back on the Credit/Debit card.6 Customer explains to the scam department that there is nothing wrong with his information because he used the same card making another purchase with another online company around the same time he ordered from Fanatics.com and there is nothing wrong with the other companys order that he purchased something from7. Customer requests a supervisor , then the real games begin with the company of Fanatics.com8. Both Supervisor and representatives try to over talk the customer, dance around the lies that the company told regarding the customer supposably canceling out his own order.9. Customer informs everyone that he has been working customer service ect ect for over 15 years and that he is from New York and this scam would never work on him, he also informs Fanatics.com reps that he would be doing multiple reviews on all social media platforms , starting Federal Civil Litigation paperwork in Federal Court for Fruad, and contacting his credit card company to to dispute all of the charges, and further block this company from making charges on the card. 10. Company instatly issues a full refund , while customer was on the phone with the financial institution (credit card company/bank)In conclution never do business with Fanatics.com or the NBAstore.com.",2023-05-02,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

In some cases, orders with multiple items are shipped in more than one package.

It has taken over two weeks to see a tracking status, which is finally ""Shipment Ready for UPS""Tracking and shipping is not really by UPS, item is batched to a warehouse and at some point goes to USPS for delivery.  Customers pay shipping plus a handling fee for each order.  Mail Innovations is the batch shipper with 18 digit tracking number starting with 8.  Tracking indicates: ""Not a day definite service.

"Woody Collectibles","My last time buying from this company. You have two options when you want to return a faulty item. Get a gift card or pay 10$ and get a refund. So I chose to get a gift card, and had 120$ sent in about a week. I try to spend it on a black Mets jersey but it said it was out of stock for like 3 weeks. I ask customer service when it will be in stock and they say they don’t know. So I wait another week or two and continuously check to see if it’s in stock, and finally, one day it is. In my size too. The only size available is medium, so I spend my gift card on it. I wait for about 10 days and it just continuously says that my order is still processing. I open the website back up and it says my order is cancelled, although I never cancelled it. I go to customer service and they say it’s out of stock. If it’s out of stock, then why did you let me buy it? I then asked when it will be back in stock and they said the middle of June. Mind you, this situation began at the start of March, and I most likely have my jersey arrive until the start of July. Ridiculous. Order number is 107-6650-2797.This is the only compensation I got (in an email)We truly apologize for any inconvenience.

However, it does not fit the Samsung s21. I promptly called to ask for a return label. They told me that because it was ""customized"" I couldn't return it. I explained that the only ""customization"" are the same letters that they printed on it, just in a different spot. They told me that even if I put a period at the bottom it's considered customization and they can't give me back my money. I would never spend $50 on a phone case when I can get one on Cellular Outfitter for $10. But I always wanted a Yankee cell phone case so I was willing to spend the money one time.

"Lisa & Darren P","I must say I have had to get in touch with customer service on numerous occasions over the last year or two. The best way to do so I have found is going through the chat option. It takes quite a while to get through all the questions to finally get to someone to speak to. I find it's good to also leave an email. Although the people are pleasant to speak to it's hard to get situations resolved. This time however Michael did a fantastic job in helping me finish placing my order. As we say in America he bent over backwards to help me resolve the problem and even tried to get one of the items expedited to me since I needed this for a sixteenth birthday. He said he did his best to see if they could get it to me sooner than it is expected. Unfortunately it didn't come sooner but it was nice that he tried. He was very professional understanding and helpful. It's nice to have a person like Michael because it can get very frustrating with the long wait times to be able to chat to someone regarding your issue. Sometimes they cannot even help you resolve your situation, and your are instructed to call someone else. If you have placed an order, but need to change something or add something, once it's placed It's placed. However, I did call and they did refund 1 of the shipping costs, so I didn't have to double pay on shipping. I was happy I decided to also leave an email regarding a sale price that changed the day after I placed the order. I called customer service the next day and they were not able to help me and advised me to call the company and gave me their phone number, but since it was the weekend  I couldn't get in touch with someone until Monday. I'm not sure why she couldn't resolve the situation when I called other than it was a company I needed to speak to myself regarding it. So they are very accommodating and helpful, it just gets stressful to have to follow up with someone else to resolve your issue. If you need to change your order or add to it,  you won't be able to, once the order is placed, it's placed. Some companies will allow you a thirty minute grace period to amend your order if needed or add to it.

"Kazuyoshi","I recently purchased two hoodies from overseas, but a few hours after the payment was processed, the company cancelled my order. The reason might be that the coupon had expired right before I made the payment, resulting in the payment amount being lower than expected. Although I could accept the cancellation, I'm now facing another issue. Since that day, the company has prohibited me from logging in to my account, and I'm unable to make a purchase again. I've confirmed that my email address and password are correct, but my account seems to be frozen, including my ability to reset my password. I can only receive support via phone, as I can not inquire about my account suspension via email or chat. It is a shame that I cannot receive support via other means because I am not proficient in spoken English and can only communicate via phone.",2023-04-10,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Carolyn Mason","I placed an order for a Jersey for my son for Easter. I put in his shipping information at school in Minnesota. I paid with Apple Pay and for some reason they used my home address in North Carolina. Did online chat and called and they said since it had been over 30 minutes they couldn’t correct the mistake They made. I could get partial shipping paid to me after it came to NC and then I would have to mail it to Minnesota. Huh? Let’s see Easter will be over by the time that happens. CST said I couldn’t cancel or change the address all within an hour of ordering. Can’t file a dispute with the bank because Fanatics has a post date of the 7th of April but it has been subtracted out of my account April 4 so in turn that money is gone until I return the item. Ridiculous. Never again Fanatics!David, I talked to 2 CST and a supervisor. So, I’m sorry I don’t feel like spending  another hour of my day for my blood pressure to go up.

"MLM","The one time last summer I received assistance from a supervisor regarding a purchase was the ONLY TIME I received any help on ordering issues, returns & refunds. It got to the point I filed a dispute several months ago regarding a different order I returned items, fanatics CONFIRMED this yet no refund following 2 months of status updates! Most recently, sent back a sweatshirt that was ordered in a women’s small but was sent a men size with a stain!!! Today (3/31/2023) I get a nasty email that fanatics won’t do business with me, respond to calls & I must MAIL their office!!! Yeah hmmm no, especially if I need to check on refund status of the stained item just returned. Better venues to shop at this one is a disgrace.UPDATED: I just sent an email as requested to the email provided in the below response. I don’t know if anyone will receive it as the email I received earlier today from Fanatics stated any email I send to them will not be replied to. I am also blocked from viewing my account. I am therefore unable to track the refund status of return in transit, prior returns, or if I have a FanCash balance. Perhaps a complaint to the BBB is needed. Especially if there’s a balance I cannot view (& can’t be applied to future orders now), that’s theft. Without access to my order history how do I track refund status? Perhaps another dispute is needed now too. Ridiculous (this is also why I always save shipping receipts).",2023-04-27,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

They told me Fanatics company policy was to wait THREE business days until they declare anything “lost”. This forced me to wait 2 more days, which then included the weekend since they aren’t business days. I reached back out nearly a WEEK after the “delivery” date to have a replacement shipped to find out the item was out of stock. (Most likely forever due to the nature of the product). Fix this immediately it’s the most boneheaded customer service policy I’ve ever had to deal with and it cost me a very cool piece of memorabilia, simply because the policy was to sit around and hope for the best while other people bought up the inventory.

It’s been 60 days, and all I get from customer service on the phone and email is they are awaiting more information to provide, they have no idea when it will be available to ship, sorry for your frustration, you can cancel at any time. How about getting the product to your customer that was ordered 2 months ago? I was given a gift card for Fanatics, which was to save me a chunk of the cost of the jersey. So now I have to cancel and pay full price elsewhere because Fanatics could care less about their customers. No company anywhere I’ve dealt with has been clueless as to when an order will ship. Avoid this company unless you enjoy headachesUpdate: Did as Jessica asked in her response, and I still got the same reply from the customer first email address.

On 2/15/2023 I called to inquire about what was happening, listened to the ""robot"" and asked to speak with a representative. I actually talked with a very nice lady. She checked my order # and told me that i had been mailed a ""gift card"". I told her that I had never received a gift card nor any communication from Fanatics. According to paperwork that I printed off on 2/14/23, according to Fanatics,I was due a refund of $96.29, which was much less than what I paid for the jacket, but I was told that I would not get the full amount of $114.46 unless I did an even exchange or a gift card. She apologized. I told her that another shirt was what I had originally asked for but after this long a time, I just wanted credit, not a gift card. She took care of my request and said that I should receive an email telling me that the amount of $96.29 was credited back to my credit card and to look for that to be done within the next 2-14days. As of today, 3/6/23, I had no credit and had not received any emails. I called again and spoke with another very nice lady and repeated my ongoing problem. She also apologized many times and said that because of the high volume of returns over the holidays that there was a backlog in getting credit to everyone and that I should be hearing back something soon. I then asked to speak to a Supervisor. I was put on hold and she spoke to someone and came back and said that I had been moved to the top of the list and should get an email within the next 24 hrs and then to look for credit in 2-7 business days. I received an email within 2 hours and was told in the email that I would now receive a credit of $86.30 due to the cost of a $9.99 return label fee that was deducted. I am extremely unhappy with this customer service. How can this company do business this way?",2023-03-04,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Brady Phillips","My complaints are several.1- I looked up a sweat shirt a few days ago for my daughter. It was $39.99. I decided against it.2- Showed up in my facebook feed advertised at $29.99, clicked and it was $39.99...still.3- Checked facebook today, clicked on link, it was indeed $29.99. Went to purchase.4- Saw I was charged $14.99 for expedited shipping5- I did not want the expedited shipping and find setting it as the default dishonest. 5- Sent an e-mail to listed customer service address6- Got a bounce back that it was not monitored and given a phone number7- Called customer service number and was on hold for 15 minutes.On the positive side, the CSR was very good. I appreciated his help. Cancelled the order and will not order from them again...why should I?

"Mr. D Wallace","Tried to order a football shirt for my grandson 3 times. First time I forgot to ask for express delivery so I got on the chat line and was told very abruptly that the only way to fix it was to cancel the order and start again which seems ridiculous. SO I did that. I had looked at the size comparison chart which is confusing as it has 2 charts for kids with different sizes for the same age brackets. So I ordered a xs small which on the chart said was for 7-8 years. It was tiny. Got on the chat line and was told I'd have to send it back but because I'd ordered the wrong size I had to pay but as it was  for a birthday present I did that to get things moving. So then I ordered a 10-12 years shirt (now at this point I've paid for 3 shirts and had one refund). The 3rd shirt came and was tiny also. Apparently I'd ordered a ""little kids"" size. Who describes 10-12 year olds as little kids? Only these guys. So I sent that back again at my expense and I went and bought a shirt elsewhere. I have 3 grandsons and 2 grand daughters all play football and none will be getting any from these people. The chat line people are very curt and unhelpful. I'm still waiting for the other 2 refunds despite having the sent the goods back via courier.",2023-03-01,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"JP","I purchased a Custom Authentic Pro Stock Jersey, NJ Devils Hughes 3Rd ""Jersey"" Jersey from Shop NHL/Fanatics on December 30th 2022. For several weeks, there were multiple delays in fulfilling the order. The delays was apparently because of an issue with the 3rd party vendor.After numerous attempt to resolve the issue with customer service, too many to actual count, I decided to email an executive at Fanatics.I have to say, I should have done that sooner. Although there was a cancellation of the order by Fanatics during my email communication, the executive called me multiple times and within a week of working thru the issue, a Jersey is on it's way to me, shipped priority overnight.I know Fanatics has its detracters, however for a high ranking executive to reach out to me by phone and email, speaks volumes about their desire to help their fans. Fanatics is a 2 Billion Dollar Company and they showed me, they cared enough to look into a fans issue, and correct a wrong. That is absolutely amazing to me.On talking with the executive what struck a cord for them was that I was direct, to the point and although I was dismayed, the email was polite and I felt that Fanatics should not forget the people on which their success was built on. They did not!Their actions are proof for enough for me that they were true to their motto,""By Fans for Fans""In addition, because of the delay, I was refunded the cost of the Jersey. It was worth the wait!! Good job to the executive(s) of Fanatics and the employees within the process, for caring about their customers. Thank you!!",2023-02-28,5,"Trust Pilot",NA

Also, when asking about the long lead time, i was told it takes an extra 3 working days for customisation. 3 DAYS! I can enter any sports shop and have this done in 20 minutes.

"Easton M.","After the Colorado Avalanche won the cup, I immediately jumped on to the NHLShop (Fanatics). I purchased a variety of things, but the major items were two autographed jerseys and three autographed pucks. Over $1,500.The site made me aware that those items would take 2-3 months as they were autographed. Cool, no biggie, I get it. I figured it was June, it would be here for the holidays and I can give my Dad a Jersey and a puck, since we watched the Avs all the time as a kid and them winning the cup again was all great memories.The orders finally got a ship date, which was actually in August. I was super excited. That date came and went, nothing. I contacted them to be told it had been delayed back to September. Ok, cool.That date came.... and went. Same story, contacted, now it was October.Well... Then the same thing happened, but moving to November, then December, January, February, and now I am being told April. Their agents just keep telling me that I can cancel the items and get a refund instead. They do not care.

"Felicia Helton","I have placed THREE different orders with this site. First order 107-5419-8075 I had ordered in March of 2021. I was told I would have it by April 16th, 2021. On August 2, 2021 I finally cancelled my order with them because they said it was a ""very popular item and is taking longer than expected."" Then I purchased a jersey that was in stock, and received that order fairly quickly. I thought, maybe they had figured things out and gotten past these shipment delays. My husband really wanted a Pacers City Jersey. I saw it on there and you could put a custom name on it. So after having better luck the second go around, I placed a third order on December 29th 2022. 365-3262-9098. I was told I would get it by February 1st, 2023. I thought this was the PERFECT Valentines Day gift. When February 1st came and went I called. I was assured I would have this order in time for Valentine's Day. So I waited. Then my order got delayed again. I have reached out several times and heard ""It's a very popular item."" ""We are having manufacturing issues"" ""It's in stock, should be shipped out in a couple of days"" etc. It is now February 23rd, and I got another email stating it was delayed. I have given up and canceled another order. Only order from them if it is IN STOCK and Ready to ship THAT DAY. Do not PREORDER anything from them or use their Customized Product services because if you do, good luck on ever receiving that item.  If they cannot offer services in a timely manner, or have an actual delivery date then they just shouldn't offer those services. It's quite frustrating.",2023-02-23,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"EA","Purchased a NFL Jersey picture frame from Fanatics as a Christmas present. First one came damaged in shipping. They had me ship it back and reorder another one. Received the new one, and this one was also damaged/defective and separated in one corner of the frame. They had the corner protective cardboard piece on it holding it together and we did not notice the damage until we unpacked it to put it up. Not sure if this is a defect issue or if it was damaged in shipping, either way it cannot be repaired due to to the v nails used in the corners. The corner was not reinforced properly since it came apart like this and it hasn’t even been hung up yet. Imagine how dangerous this would have been had it separated while on the wall! I  called customer service, sent pictures and now they refuse to exchange the item or even send me a refund. When I questioned if this was a known issue with the item, the representative acknowledged that they have have had some returned for being defects/damage from time to time. Now I am out over $222.91 and my son is still waiting for his Christmas present. Buyer beware Fanatics does not stand by their products.",2023-02-02,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"David Watson","On December 28th 2022 I ordered a Brock Purdy 49ers Jersey from the San Francisco 49ers website.  The jersey was marketed to me on the website as being available and a very popular item. As a life long 49er fan and someone who had just watched Brock Purdy break a record and get his jersey in the hall of fame. I thought it would be nice to have one.  So I went ahead and ordered it through what I thought was the 49er website.  It took me to another site. NFL.shop.com. I saw that the jersey  had a ship date of January 11th. So I went ahead and ordered it.  They took my money immediately.  As soon as I get the order confirmation notification(five minutes at most,later) via email the ship date had changed to January 21st.Slightly annoyed by this tactic I went to try to talk to their customer service. I got an annoying chat bot that only allows stressful multiple choice picks for why you are there. Of course mine isnt there.  After several frustrating minutes with the AI chatbot I was sent to a cancelation page.  I could not cancel my order because it said I needed to have an account number to cancel and then go into my orders to start the cancelation process.  I checked out as a guest and had now hit a brick wall with fanatics because I did not create an account when they took my money.So I thought whatever just wait until the 21st when it ships. I immediately started getting several emails a day from all their companies, nfl.shop.com,fanatics.com and several others that I did not open.  All of these emails had ""Information about your order"" in the subjct line to make you think there would be info about your order but nope, just the same tired January 21st ship date.  Like an idiot I bought another Jersey for my daughter and that jersey shipped and arrived fairly quick.  From that point on any of the emails I received would refer to that order,the one I had received for my daughter and not the one I had paid 150 dollars for and not received. When I would try to check on that order and put in the details for it instead of showing me those details it would instead show me the order for my daughter which had been delivered. I am not sure how this could happen since I put the order number in.  Horrible experience so far but it gets better.So on January 20th about 830pm  I get yet another generic automated email thanking me for the patience I ran out of weeks ago and letting me know that unfortunately there would be another delay and now the item would ship January 30th. Even more annoyed I tried to cancel again with the AI chat bot.  The chat bot did not show me a ship date but now had a delivery date of February 13th.  They bait you in with a ship date but then take that away and give you a delivery date that is quite away out from that ship date.   I got stuck at the account screen again and could not cancel again because I did not create an account. No where did I see before they took my money that I would need to create an account in order to receive customer service.  But that was the case two times.  I could not get any help with their ""fan advocates"" either time as I was informed they were busy helping other fans and I should try back later.  Very frustrating waste of time on both occasions.  If you are still reading this then you probably know whats coming next.January 29th I had not received a shipping notification or another delay email as I had unsubscribed to all of their emails so I went back to the chat bot and now saw that my delivery date had again changed to February 23rd.  At this point I just want to cancel,  So again with the chat bot and the confirming of the order number and email and names.  This time I do get a fan Advocate and again I confirm everything and after I say I dont want this anymore and I want to cancel. She comes back and this is verbatim because I took screen shots of the entire chat exchange to prove that she refused to help me because I would not give her  my phone number. She said "" I'll Be more than happy to help you with this!  To be sure that I have the correct information, do you mind providing your phone number please?""Now as I mentioned I checked out as a guest and did not use my phone number, nor do I want this horrible company to have my phone number.  I informed the rep that I had not used my phone number and I dont wish to give it and I had already confirmed my order number, email address and do not want to provide more info.  She insisted that I provide the phone number or she would not help me.  I let her know I would not be playing games with them and wanted the order canceled or I would take all this information to the bank and charge back the item since they had never shipped it. I did manage to screen shot the entire conversation in the 45 seconds before she read my message and quickly sent me the canned ""I cant help you without your phone number message""  and then left the chat without saying anything further. She was of no help",2023-01-29,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Laur","I’ve been ordering from here for many years, especially around Christmas time. In December 2022, I ordered Christmas gifts that were a “XMAS guarantee by 12/23” I placed my order on 12/16 and didn’t receive one of the items until 12/29. Fanatics choose to ship it a cheaper option which meant being passed off to the post office and it took so long to get to me. Every other company I ordered from around Christmas was either next day or 2 day shipping using FedEx or UPS. Fanatics charged me a handling fee, while these other companies charged me nothing and got me my orders in time as promised. I chatted in with support thinking they could assist me or even credit me the handling fee I paid since they advertised 12/23 guarantee and didn’t hold up their end. I was very wrong. Their chat was very unresponsive, leaving me in silence for long periods of time. They told me their “guarantee” doesn’t matter and offered me nothing. When I asked about the handling fee I paid, they refused to credit the measly couple dollars. So disrespectful and disgusting that such a large company had no compassion that a loyal customer is missing a Christmas gift for a loved one. After this awful experience, I did some quick research and found this company is notorious for awful customer service. I had no idea, but now I do and they surely lost a long time customer from not only me, but my family and friends too. I had to explain at our large Christmas gathering that someone’s gift was missing because of Fanatics and everyone was shocked at how they treated the situation. We all agreed mistakes happen, but since they make a big deal over how their products will arrive by 12/23, then say too bad when it fails, is a shady business tactic. Maybe don’t plaster the “arrives by 12/23” all over your website in big banners and in product descriptions, which is so misleading if you won’t honor it or attempt to remedy the situation when you fail to hold up your promise. Doing this, encourages people to order and you know that. You’re taking advantage of paying customers and it shows when you do NOTHING to remedy an issue on your end. I’ve never been treated this way by any company and have even received coupons and credits automatically with an apology email without chatting in, when the company fails to deliver. Ironically, you chose to donate all sales from a specific jersey, while telling loyal customers like me too bad. I guess the little bit of publicity and news is better than treating your long time customers properly. I have already moved to ordering from a competitor and will forever do so because you couldn’t even give me acceptable customer service.",2023-01-10,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

They first told me it went to Fan Cash and I didn't spend it before January 1st so I lost it. The other customer service people (those who spoke English well enough to understand) told me they would email me my response which after providing multiple email accounts never arrived! Still out my money! I will be reporting to BBB but take my advice and find product somewhere else! How do they get away with stealing money?",2023-01-10,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Adam Kaczmarek","I purchased a rugby top off Fanatics, paying £4.95 delivery charge. This did arrive but was too small. I then had to pay £5.90 to return this. I then ordered the larger size, again paying £4 95, but thos did not arrive. I was reimbursed for the price of the rugby top but not the delivery.All in all, I have paid £14.80 and have nothing to show for it. Contacting Fanatics is almost impossible as everything is automated. Terrible service.*** Edit*** I had emailed Fanatics as instructed and this was their attempt at sorting something out. Absolutely laughable response.Hello Adam,Thank you for your email,If you were to place an order with us we would certainly despatch the jersey, however, I cannot speak for the courier's unfortunately, you are more than welcome to place the order if you wish I do apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience Sincerely, AveryFan Advocate - Fan Services and SupportFanatics",2023-01-10,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

What return, never received it. 1st person was really no help.  Called again and this one said it was an issue with the quality and they could not ship it but a different batch was available and I could reorder. She sent an email with a link for 20% off the same item and said shipping would be free. After I placed the order realized I was charged $4.99 for delivery, so I canceled the order and used the same link but then the 20% was not available. Called and spoke to someone else and she said it was company policy you could not use 2 discounts on 1 order! Went ahead and ordered the darn shirt as it as supposed to be a present for our grandson.  Said I would never order from Fanatics again! Well, yesterday I get an email for Dallas Cowboy items, not realizing it was from Fanatics, and ordered a shirt that said delivery tomorrow. Completed the order and at check out it showed $9 expedited delivery charge. Thought oh well, I’ll get it soon. Got email today that item shipped but expected delivery not until next Friday! Contacted via chat and was told that weekends aren’t included in the days so Monday will be the shipping date. How the heck is that expedited? This is all very deceptive and bait and switch.

So ignore their early Black Friday sales....especially if it's a Christmas gift for someone that can't try it on for some time after purchase.  I was told by customer service that it's best to only order a couple weeks before Christmas so items are able to be exchanged if needed.

"Richard Hamilton","Hello,Recently I ordered four items in one order from Fanatics.  There was no rush to receive the order but it got to me in great time, which was a great start, however this is where it fell off a cliff and I will never use this company again.I, like so many other online purchasers by clothing online because of ease of use and access, of which you expect to be able to return any item that does not fit, for free.  The clothing from Fanatics is not something you can obtain off the high street so I used them because of this.As I stated initially, I ordered four items in one go and Fanatics cleverly sent them to me separately meaning that not only do I have to pay £7.50 to send clothing back (yes that's correct, £7.50 for one item!), I have to pay it twice!!  So £15 to send back four jumpers that do not fit because the sizing is incorrect, but somehow this will not be free, it will be 3 times more what I paid to receive them!Do not use Fanatics unless you are 100% sure of your sizing.  I am a large in most UK stores, I ordered four jumpers in a large and they are all too small.  Do not expect that some of the items being from the  States are larger in size, they're not!*Update* 3/1/23As of today, I have emailed this company twice, both times three days ago, and also attempted to use their horrendous chat system on multiple times, and I have been ignored across both platforms.

What really happens is, they put all of our money in the bank for 30 days, before processing the order. After gaining interest, compounded daily, they make so much money, they don't care about YOUR FEELINGS. My order was placed on December 12th, Order Number:279-4554-3591. They say it shipped on the 17th of December. So, I get an email on December 23rd from UPS saying that they would let me know when it will be shipped. So, they get to keep gaining interest for another month on our money. Don't be mad, they gotta make a living too. BTW, it now says my order will be delivered by January 17th.

"Gary","UDATE: David from Fanatics.com stepped up to provide some resolution to my situation. The $9.99 refund processing fee was removed. I had ordered a size 2XL jacket and paid $15.99 for expedited delivery to get it here by Christmas Day. David waived the shipping fee and somehow got my package to me on time after tracking showed that it would not arrive until the 27th. And the refund on the XL jacket has already been processed. It's unfortunate that it took a couple negative posts to get some action - but in the end David and Fanatics made it right! Thank you David!********There is a total lack of any customer service at this website. Sure, they have a ""chat bot"" - but it is absolutely useless unless your issue exactly matches their defined response options. I bought a size large Detroit Tigers jacket. It was more like a small/medium - nowhere close to a ""Large"". And, sure they say ""365 day"" returns - but what they don't say is that they will deduct $9.99 from your refund to process the return. And then - the return email you get says to take it to any UPS location and drop it off. NOPE!

They gave me a 30 day delivery window, which is a bit excessive, but I can understand with the holiday season. The order was listed as shipped a few days after I placed my order (Nov 23rd). For weeks, there was no update on the order. I finally contacted customer service. Sara C informed me my order was delayed “due to the high demands on shipping companies this holiday season.” Conveniently, after our conversation, the package status was updated on Dec 7th to being “in transit” in Jamaica, NY. A week later and no update again. So I contacted Sara again, who informed me my order was now lost!!!! It was now December 13th and 12 days before Christmas and now I don’t have a gift for my husband! Sara’s excuse was yet again “the high demands on the shipping companies.” She did offer me to send a replacement and a hat thrown in or a refund, which was a good alternative. I took the replacement but asked that they rush shipping so I have the order by Christmas. She couldn’t guarantee it and wouldn’t give me an updated status on the new shipment. Listen, I get it, it’s a busy time of the year but I order this well in advance for this reason. You cannot tell me this company is incapable of rush shipping a replacement jersey due to their own incompetence? Yet on their website, they guarantee deliveries by Christmas? What kind of company is this? I feel like I’m dealing with some scam company that’s trying to steal my money, rather than a major corporation. I ended up asking for a refund, which they told me could take between 4-10 business days to hit my bank account (WHAT?). I ended up spending more money at NFLproshop with an estimated delivery date of Dec 27th. Thanks, Fanatics, for ruining my husband’s Christmas.

Reading some other reviews, it seems that my experience has also been shared by some other customers. I too would not even give them one star. I ordered an England coat for my son ( Christmas present ) and when it arrived I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the item. The Nike swoosh/England emblem were made of cheap plastic and looks very poor quality. The website does not allow you to zoom in on products, and had a seen that the badge was not embroidered, I would not have purchased. On this view I believe that the website is misleading. I attempted to contact Fanatics on numerous occasions via their useless instant chat. After countless times I gave up due to ' There is no adviser available ' message repeating itself. I then phoned the customer services number and waited for around 25 minutes before my call was answered. The advisers line was awful and the communication was lost in translation. I was required to send an email and photographs of the product to an email address given. A few minutes later I received an email stating that this email address is not monitored !!! Now I was starting to get angry.....After some research I found another email address, and after some correspondence I was sent a free returns link.

"James","Absolutely shocking.  Do not use.  Ordered a shirt for my son's Christmas on 10th December which said it would be delivered before Christmas (21st Dec) and then 4 days later it is now saying delivery on 3rd January.  Rung them up - on hold for 20 minutes and when I was being put through, it cut off.  Convenient.  Rung again and went on hold for another 15 minutes and then spoke to a gentleman called Casey who couldn't offer any solutions and no discount.  Seemed to suggest it was my issue!  Don't use them and avoid.  They advertise on TV but they are not set up to run their business.  Also, they look after NFL Europe so don't order from there either.",2022-12-15,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

As I am located in Canada I was concerned it would be a major hassle to return the damaged display case and receive a replacement item. I connected with a rep on the fanatics chat who directed me to a 1-800 number where I connected with a fan advocate. Ashley was professional and quickly worked toward a resolution of a replacement display case. I emailed pictures of the damage and she quickly responded to let me know she got them and that I would hear back in 2 business days. Less than 24 hours later I heard back from Ashley that a replacement display case was being shipped out and my new confirmation information.Very pleased with the service from Ashley and fanatics to quickly solve the issue!",2022-12-14,5,"Trust Pilot",NA

"CM","This company has a poor business model.  They allow customer service robots to continually redirect you to the point that you never get anything corrected by live humans. The online chat is always unavailable and if you finally get a person on live chat, you don’t get a definitive answer.   I have spent 6 hours trying to simply set up a return.  I began the return online as instructed but never got a return email or shipping label.   It is costly to return anything if I ever get to that point! You lose the initial shipping fee, the original Handling fee and an additional 9.99 when you need to return items.   So you are 20.00 in the hole if you need to return anything.   I have tweeted, facebooked, live chatted three times and downloaded copies of all of the chats with different answers.   The clothing is expensive so they need better customer support to make returns easier.

The second order for a personalized authentic Adidas Bruins Jersey ordered November 12th - this order for a Christmas gift - has sat 'in processing' since it was ordered.  It says delivery December 15th - but it has yet to leave processing.  My Third order December 1st for sweats and car accessories for Christmas said that it would be delivered by December 19 and 20.  I actually HAVE received the sweats already.  I have called Fanatics about the Christmas gift that is still 'in processing' and they told me to give it a few more days to update.  Then I received an email saying they cannot reach their own warehouse and giving me the option to cancel the order.  I don't want to cancel the order I want the shirt and I want an honest answer as to when it will be here! I tried to talk someone via the chat function last night. Vanessa introduced herself and asked me a bunch of questions to verify my order and then promptly went silent. Nothing.  I am beyond upset about my dealings with your company.

The other two caps were shipped using UPS Innovations with a promised delivery date of November 17, 2022, I was provided a tracking number.  The tracking indicated that UPS delivered the merchandise to USPS and the system was waiting for acceptance by USPS. Well since my caps were never delivered I contacted Fanatics on November 20, and I was told wait 3 more days. On November 25, when my caps still had not been delivered. Fanatics agreed to reship the items and gave me a new tracking number with a delivery date of December 8.  Well it is December 10 and I still do not have the caps.  I checked the new tracking number and I discovered that the merchandise is stuck in a shipping loop similar to the November shipment. I contacted Fanatics and they told me through the chatbot to wait three days and that they will either reship or refund, after this experience I do not trust the company and I want my money refunded. I put this transaction in dispute with my credit card company so I will now let the bank handle this situation.  I have bought thousands of dollars in merchandise from Fanatics in the past, but I never thought that Fanatics would treat customers so badly.

I found this to be very unacceptable due to the fact I will be out of town now without my order. I only placed the order because it said it would be here next day.

"customer","I bought 2 hats and when I received them, one of them was mis-sized and extremely small. I reached out to customer service and was asked if I’d like a refund or a replacement hat and I told them that I would like the hat. Customer support sent me a shipping label (he said so that I wouldn't have to pay for shipping) and that the new hat would be shipped asap. A few days later I noticed a refund from Fanatics for much less than what I paid and figured that maybe they issued a partial refund for whatever reason and would still ship the hat but a month later, I see that wasn’t the case. I understand that mistakes happen and they can’t control mis-sized hats from the manufacturer but they don’t make it right even when they say they will. I had no control over receiving a defective item, was told that I would be sent a replacement then wasn’t even refunded the amount I paid (I’m guessing to cover their shipping costs).

We have tried on numerous occasions to ralk to someone, even via the live chat that they have and there is nobody to answer phones or live chat.  We get a message that the agents are not available! What! And, when you click ""gift return"", it says it's a bad link.  👎   This is unacceptable.  Fanatics, you need to provide customer service, be there for us!",2022-10-29,2,"Trust Pilot",NA

Fanatics customer service representatives, have literally lied to me, ignored/ not acted on multiple requests for help, misinformed me multiple times, and is now trying to cover it up because i’m being told BS that contradicts actual events. Due to the incompetence of these people in solving the issue of my package being lost, I’ve been waiting for my order for a month and a half and still don’t have my items. And one of the items I ordered, was of emotional importance to me. And in the meanwhile it isn’t even in stock anymore, so God knows how long I’ll have to wait to get a chance to re order! I was told maybe 5 times i would be contacted via email to solve the issue but NEVER received even one mail! I had to contact them myself out of own initiative, 2 times back to back in 1 day, to even find out they finished the investigation in the first place, and hear the results of it. (I was only told an investigation would be needed, the second time I contacted them to tell them the postal service lost my package btw, so good luck figuring out the logic of that). Also a lot of the representatives do not speak adequate English for an easy interaction. Some of these scentences i’m getting are pretty confusing and unclear! Sometimes I need to ask a question 5 different times, worded differently every time, and I still can’t get an answer that doesn’t confuse me or give me more questions then I had in the first place. 0/10 IGN",2022-10-14,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"JMorgan51511","I specifically jumped online to find out where I can post a positive review about Fanatics.com and full transparency I'm beyond surprised to see the experience rating here on Trustpilot. I've had nothing but an absolute top shelf premium 5 STAR experience with Fanatics. I almost feel the icing on the cake arrived today when I received an order to the sum of several hundreds of dollars worth of LA Dodger and LA Rams collectible/memorabilia. The attention to detail in the packaging alone not to mention how pleased I am with the quality products of my most memorable times watching my teams success particularly recently. These items were boxed/displayed in custom boxes around each frame (also packed within wrap and larger boxes) revealing just enough to put a big smile on my face as I unpacked the boxes. I have an instant connection to these items now! I had them delivered to a municipal complex being a city employee and had no issues. I will be decorating my office first thing tomorrow morning and I'm so very excited about it. The Fanatics MVP rewards program earns credit towards future purchases quite quickly and the FanCash Rewards Card account I love and the convenience of it is outstanding.

"AR","Probably the worst buying experience I've ever had, to the point that I'm quite astounded that this company even exists. Appalling service, not even attempting to ship on time but still charging a premium for it. Customer service people are clearly instructed to obstruct the customer as much as possible and attempt to deny their consumer rights.  If you find yourself in the misfortune of having ordered something from a Fanatics subsidiary, I would recommend going straight to your credit card company and pursuing a charge back, you'd save some time that way.",2022-09-22,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Soccer Mom","I wish I had read the reviews for Fanatics before buying a gift for someone on their site. The shipping is the WORST. I placed my order almost 2 weeks ago, the tracking for my shipped item fell off a week ago and now Fanatics can't tell me where my item is or when my item will arrive. I have to wait another 3 days from now before they'll even consider giving me a refund, meanwhile, it's now too late to give the gift on time. It's also almost impossible to get a customer service rep on the phone. I will never order from Fanatics again, I'd give zero stars if that were an option.",2022-09-22,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Simon Dearing","I have now made my third order with them but unfortunately this experience means it will likely be my last.Ordered a number of football shirts from them which like the last 2 orders took a little longer to arrive then I would expect but I wasn't too concerned by that.I had a discount code that I had used which also included free shipping, however I was then charged £7.95 for shipping, despite all of the shirts coming in the same parcel.Unfortunately one of the shirts is far too small so I wish to return and exchange but when using the returns portal it always says order not found and I keep going in loops.Their chat bot agents are never available so I can only assume do not exist, and the only pre templated responses take you back to the same returns portal.I know that Fanatics are notorious for price gauging to over inflate so that they can then pepper you with discount emails but the lack of customer service is a concern.Its also frustrating when their discount codes do not seem to work correctly either so overcharge you for some items.I have tried their email address which I found on here where some of their customer service agents appear to respond to but no reply as yet. Now it appears I have no option but to try the credit card route to see if I can get some money back there.How they can put 365 day returns, not to mention 14 day returns with free postage (as is UK LAW!) is beyond me. It appears the strategy is to just delay as long as they can to try to make you give up or let the timer run out to force you to spend on returns.",2022-08-23,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

I paid $53.09 and received back $33.89, so I'm out $19.20 in addition to the inconvenience of not having the hat I ordered.

Two of the three things I purchased were to be delivered next business day and the third item was supposed to be shipped 3 business days from date of purchase. I received email confirmation of my order and I thought all was well.Fast forward to 8/1 (today) and I go to log into my account to make sure my two items were still on track for delivery today.  I was unable to log in. I kept entering my information and it kept coming back with an error. I clicked the “forgot password” option, thinking I am not inputting something correctly.I received a message saying that I would receive an email if my account was valid. I’ve yet to receive said email.I go back to my original email and click the hyperlink that contained my order number, instead. That took me to the Fanatics website and showed that my items were canceled. I reach out to customer service to see what the heck is going on. Again, I’m expecting items to deliver today. The chat agent says that my items were canceled because my payment method was flagged. Say what?No email correspondence that my order was canceled. No chance to rectify whatever the issue was (even though the money was debited perfectly fine when I placed my order). Incredibly frustrating. I’ve purchased from Fanatics three times over the last 9-10 months and they have had to cancel items two of the three times (the other time was because they didn’t have the items I ordered).

So I did make a new account with different email address and shipping to my friends address - Fanatics cancelled order again and blocked new account and new address (Haha, now my friend can't order from Fanatics, because his address in now banned).

"Aranoch","Long story but here we go. I placed my order on April 1st, 2022. Without notice, my order was delayed by well over a month. I was not told and my emails were not replied to regarding my order status. After it passed the date I was supposed to receive it and emails went unnoticed I reached out to their chat system and eventually got somebody who told me it was 'delayed' but not how long. I decided to wait because I was really excited about the F1 jacket I ordered. After receiving the jacket over 2 months after the order was placed I realized it was much larger than I expected. I measured the jacket and the dimensions exceeded their XXL. Now typically I'd go with Mediums but because of their chart, I went with a large. After getting in touch with their chat again and explaining this to them they offered a return at the base value of the product and were going to ""let me"" order one of the correct size. This would have cost me an additional $114, unknown wait time, AND still, risk the size chart being incorrect and not fitting properly. I declined and was told I could email a complaint because they couldn't do anything to help me since it was outside of their 'return' window.. even though it was their fault in multiple ways. I sent an email with pictures, a lengthy description of the headaches I've endured, and provided my contact information, as well as anything else I could think of. I was very professional and polite, and despite my aggravation, I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. All I wanted from the beginning was to swap the wrong size for the correct one since their chart was way off, by 6 full inches around my chest alone. They responded to my email with a very blatantly copied and pasted response offering me a %10 discount for my inconvenience. I replied to this declining again and pointing out that all I wanted was an exchange, then was met with the same exact copy and pasted response.. after another reply they asked for more pictures which I provided within 24 hours and have yet to receive a response despite my follow up emails so it appears that I'm just being ignored now after all of their errors with no resolution. I'm now stuck with a jacket that I paid for months ago that is 3 sizes too big.My order was placed on April 1st. The first email complaint I sent was on June 27th and it is now July 13th with no response, no resolution, and going on 9 days without hearing back at all. Not even those pleasant copy and pasted / automated responses.TLDR; It took over 2 months to get my order with no response from my emails, and no timeline, despite my order stating it would have been here by April 29th when it was placed on April 1st. The size was WAY off and I was basically told I was out of luck and outside the return time. I received it over 2 months later and I emailed a complaint containing all info, pics, etc, and after several generic responses offering %10 off instead of fixing it, I have now stopped receiving replies at all. It's now July 13th and all I've asked for was the correct size as a replacement and as advertised. I have screenshots, images, emails, etc to back all of this up as well.",2022-07-13,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

Avoid Fanatics website.**UPDATE**Responded to the email in their reply. Provided all necessary information. And… nothing. I did finally receive my refund though.

The representative kindly reships my order with expedited deliveryJune 22: Chat again since I haven't received an email confirmation or tracking number of expedited delivery.

In the same chat, I am told the order will be delivered by the end of day (June 24th) but the representative is unable to provide a tracking number. The representative escalates my order and asks for another 72 hours to sort this out. After 25 days, they want another 3 days to sort this out?!June 24: Pretty sure my order will not be delivered by the end of day today as specified in the chats since I received an email saying that they ""have not received a new shipment update,"" and that I can cancel or wait.

She looked up the order and was able to get me a free shipping return label AND was able to next day air ship me the correct sized item to insure I had it in time for Father’s Day.

I declined a replacement only because a) I don’t have a printer (hard to understand, I know lol)  and b) I really don’t want to deal with Apple Express. I still would rather not shop Fanatics until they can confidently assure items are fulfilled by Canada Post. If that doesn’t concern you, then this is not a problem. Fanatics has friendly customer service when emailed directly. Thanks!ORIGINAL REVIEWNot really impressed. Despite their website claiming Landmark Global & Canada Post, Fanatics parcels get fulfilled by a third party courier called Apple Express. This means your packages may be at risk. I don’t want anxiety from the thought of porch pirates. There was no delivery notification until long after the time of arrival, but luckily the parcel was safe. I ordered two hats, both arrived, however one was stained. Even mentioned this  and received no response.Obviously not the end of the world, but as someone who works in customer service, I expect better. I rate Fanatics with one star, because you get what you give. Definitely won’t be shopping again.",2022-06-19,5,"Trust Pilot",NA

You used to package everything in boxes, but now shove your soft merchandise into plastic packages. And you charge over $100 for jerseys that probably aren’t even worth $40.

They have to make up for their abhorrent, almost non-existing customer service, and the fact that they are selling products they simply do not have.  I'm not even sure exactly what this company does.  It appears they are the  ""go between"" for manufacturers and their potential customers.  Whatever they are, they could not do a worse job of it.  I ordered a jersey that they advertise EVERYWHERE.  After not receiving for a month, I wrote them and their response was... it may be ready for shipping in another month. They claimed they couldn't get the materials needed to make the jersey from the manufacturer (SAY WHAT ???).  Do yourself a favor.  ANYTHING ""Fanatics"" advertises is available elsewhere.  Find via sites like this, reputable companies that don't carry a one star rating (barely) and give them your business.

"Mr William R Bowater","Last year I purchased a NFL Jersey. It was delayed in transit and after many phone calls to fanatics it finally arrived. The bag looked like it had been in a fight  and the printing on the front center had a dent in the print, it was also generally poor printing. I took photos and had a live chat witha sales agent and after sending photos they finally agreed to let me return it, they offered to give me 10% discount to keep it due the fault I declined!! Luckily I took screen shots of all our conversations. I paid for the return label and had to use the rebound return service. After a month of the item being returned this was  shown on the tracking I still was not refunded as promised. I used PayPal to complete my transaction so I was left with no other option than to open a dispute. Due to my screen shots and correspondence as evidence my dispute was instantly won and paypal refunded me but I did loose my return postage even though it states in their terms and conditions that faulty items postage will also be refunded. I have since tried to purchase a hat and sweatshirt but I've been blacklisted !!! Every time I try to complete the sale I have an email saying the was a problem with the payment. I contacted the sales team and he couldn't explain why this was happening he spoke to his manager and I was told to ask a friend or family member to purchase the item for me and they put the phone down.I have to be honest I have never been treated like this from any other company and find it disgusting that a company that sells merchandise for a franchise the size of NFL are treating its fans with faulty items and victimisation.",2022-04-04,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

And to check my bank. To which my bank confirmed no payments pending. The customer service team have been utterly shocking , I’m so gobsmacked how they talk to you. Easy 365 day returns….

"Miss K","I used to buy items from Fanatics years ago. So my brother ordered me something from here for my birthday. I have to say that the quality has gone down hill by 75%. The sizes are not standard sizing (they run really small). Sending things back is a pain. If you wanted to be refunded back to your method of payment, they take another $10 fee from your purchase, for shipping. Which lets me know that they must get a lot of returns. A company that is confident in their products, usually don't charge a fee for a return. If you want the whole amount (minus original shipping fee) you can get a gift card. But that just means you have to buy something else from their subpar company. Also this was a gift. I received it early Jan. It was ordered Dec 6! A month to ship a sweatshirt? A sweatshirt that was super thin and too small?! That's absurd. I am giving them two stars because Kristine from customer service was exceptional. She was kind and patient.

They hadn’t said anything about needing to be home to accept the delivery and the representative I was in contact with, wouldn’t confirm that is what occurred. Turns out, their solution was for me to start over with the process of waiting for a new one to be sent from one of their satellite locations... with a shipping date of December 27th and “new” guaranteed delivery date of January 6th.  Completely unacceptable as this was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my son in law!!

The Support site is an absolute nightmare with chat, having all the messages in a different order and refreshing the page and losing the connection with the fan advocate.

Fanatics know they're wrong (they admitted that they'd had multiple instances of the same issue), but they're not doing anything about rectifying them, or preventing other customers from experiencing the problem.  They wouldn't exchange my item for the right size.  I had to return it and place a new order.  They advised on the phone that they would refund the handling and shipping charges for the replacement item, but now they have my money are refusing to do so, telling me I should have returned the whole order (NOT what they told me when I was told to return the item whose size they'd incorrectly displayed).I have learned my lesson.

He then realized they misspelled TJ Oshie's name as Ohsie. I contacted Fanatics and spoke with one person who said they could fix the name plate, but we were disconnected.

I received a form email a few days later re-stating they have a 30 day return policy and I was out of luck, even though I wanted it fixed, not returned. DO NOT BUY SPECIALTY ITEMS from them.

"IreneH","Don't be deceived by their 365 day return policy. I received the items I ordered about 2 weeks late. I was comfortable shopping from their site and buying multiple items because of their stated return policy. When I tried returning after a month, it says ""Upon review, we see that this item is either customized, game used, or final sale. This type of merchandise cannot be returned."" I bought some Tokyo Olympic shirts but it never said ""Final Sale"" anywhere. What's deceiving is some Tokyo Olympics items are still returnable. So technically, they can't say ""Game used"" items. It's also impossible to reach someone from customer service. They don't list a contact number anywhere on the Help section of their site. That's because they're not sincere in helping you. The chat app is automated and is not helpful. I tried reaching them when I was worried about my shipments since it's been 2 weeks late but I couldn't reach anybody. I want to return some of the items I purchased but couldn't and they were NOT even marked as FINAL SALE when I purchased them.

"Greg Gidden","Worst sports site ever!  How are they still in business?  Prices change after putting stuff in your cart, but there are no customer service reps available to ask why.  They charge for shipping, plus a ""handling fee"" on every order AND return, and they charge a ""restocking fee"" for any item returned, along with return shipping.  So if you don't want an item after receiving it you will end up paying more trying to return it than what it cost originally. They do this to try and minimize returns, and profit off of them!  Beware before buying! They say they accept returns, but they don't tell you in advance that it will cost more to return it than what you paid.Fanatics sells items they claim are ""new"", but they arrive after several weeks in opened packages and look worn. Some of the hats I bought had hair in them. Even though you pay for shipping, it takes weeks to months to get purchases delivered. No order updates on the website.  Received an order last year 3 months after it was placed. Missing 1/4 the order, but was never informed half the stuff I bought wouldn't be available after 3 months.  Took another several weeks to get refunded for the items that never came. Since you can't call or chat with a live rep, you have to email them and wait for a response back (1-2 weeks).Such a frustrating experience all the way around.  I saw they had a huge clearance sale the other day and didn't even bother looking because I know it's a bait and switch scam.  You put some of the clearance items in your cart and when you go to checkout all the prices have increased.  They are hoping you either don't notice or just accept the price increase and complete the order anyway.

Medium for any other brand fits me comfortably.  Fanatics Mediums fit me like an X-Small, and Fanatics Large fit me like a XXL. I like a little room in a sweatshirt, but I don’t want it half way down my thigh and with a sleeve length that matches my 6’3” husbands!

"chamara polk","DO NOT ORDER!!!! I placed an order Nov 1st as my husband and I were planning to attend a football game on the 13th and were promised the items by a certain date. As time passed on, the order was then divided into two shipments. We received the first shipment in a reasonable timeframe. The second order showed that it would arrive before the first shipment. That Thursday before the game I called fanatics just wanting to cancel the order. I was told that I could not cancel it at the time, but instead they would send a cancellation ticket and at that point I would receive an email in a 72 hour period. Doesn't make sense, but okay. We go to the game and come back, and I decide to call back again in hopes of cancelling this order. The person on the phone basically called me a liar and stated that I was not told the details of what I was explained & told me if I wanted help to hang up and call back. I honestly wish I would have caught his name because the gentleman should not be in a customer service environment with that attitude. I then call back and a lady helped me. I explained my frustrations and she listened and was able to push the cancellation through so I thought. I receive an email hours later saying that it could not be cancelled, but they would waive the return fee once I received the item and I could send it back. The next day I get an email that they were unable to fulfill my order so now I have to wait 7 business days for a refund. HAD THEY CANCELLED MY ORDER WHEN I ASKED THEM TO, this would have been a better solution. I think it is complete BS not being able to cancel the order. Just say you're broke and need a loan, instead of holding on to people's money knowing you can't fulfill an order. RANT OVER!",2021-11-17,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

Customer service really is not their strong point, seems they take your money then try to pass the buck when comes to refunds on undelivered goods. Upon making my purchase I enter into a contract with Fanatics not the courier company so am within my rights to ask for a refund, only to keep being told they have to hear from the courier, so my question to unhelpful charlie was if you do not hear from the courier does this mean i do not get my refund.... funny I didn't get a reply.",2021-11-17,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Philip Friedman","I can't get over what a bad experience I had buying from their NHL team store.  I ordered gear for my daughters for a road game we were going to.  I bought gear from the Fanatics powered NHL team store on a Monday with 2 business day expedited shipping.  Well, the gear came on Friday, 4 business days after I ordered.  When I realized it would be late, I went to their site and the only way to reach their Customer Service was an AI chatbot which predictably did not have my answers.  Then I was transferred to a ""live chat"" where the nameless/faceless person offered a weak apology and offered nothing more but to refund my shipping cost.  Additionally, the answers from them came in gaps of 5 minutes per, probably looking to wait me out and kick me off the app.  The ""live chat"" experience took over 45 minutes in total.  Then I searched online found a phone number and spoke to a very nice woman who apologized multiple times and told me my only recourse was to return the items when they came and I wouldn't have to pay to send them back as long as I called back.  I could not believe that this is the experience from this Fanatics powered store, it is a modern-day example of how to NOT run an eccomerce business and I will not buy anything from Fanatics again.",2021-11-10,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

Which I find odd since the label we print doesn`t ask for a stamp... like its all covered and we will get full price back on our order... but that's not where things go bad. I proceeded to order a new sweatshirt, this time a Women's 2XL, I get it in the mail this afternoon and the sweatshirt is like a women's 2XL on the sleeves and a youth medium on the body. Its so small that if I was any taller it would have been a crop top. This is absolutely annoying and frustrating to not be able to buy a sweatshirt online before the Big Game this weekend! Anyways Fanatics, you guys need to have better details on your website so people know what they are looking at, because a 2XL should have been more than big enough for my 5`2"" self to wear.

"Christine","I needed a college sweatshirt to celebrate ED application day, so I selected something on Fanatics site that was listed as ""In Stock and Ready to Ship"" and paid $17 extra for express shipping. The next day I received my order confirmation, check on it using their ""track order"" system and it said it was scheduled for delivery in SEVEN WEEKS! I contacted customer service (boy, that's not easy) and they told me this was because they needed ""time to produce it"". So, they're selling pre-orders but representing them as items that already exist in inventory. VERY shady business practices. I have requested a refund and we'll see how long that takes. If a company needs you money in advance to produce goods, that's one thing... but if they need to advertise it falsely as being ""in stock and ready to ship"" in order to get your money, that's fraud! I do have screenshots showing it as ""In Stock - Ready to Ship"", my order date of 10/28, their estimated delivery date of 12/14, and the chat transcript where their agent says to me ""We need additional time in order to produce it and ship it out and currently are experiencing some massive delays"". Note they still need ""TO PRODUCE"" their allegedly ""IN STOCK"" item. False advertising. Delays, pandemics, shipping apocalypses, etc. aside., they have control over how they advertise things on their website. I will never purchase anything from them again.

The website would still allow you to order the exact same item with the same expected 5 day shipping! I finally got my order cancelled and then received an email saying my order could not be fulfilled. I was given a 20% off voucher, went to use it next day, didnt work.I shifted over to the fanatics UK website, why I thought it would be any different on there I dont know!Ordered the same item, 5 day shipping time again, this time given a expected delivery date that was 10 days in advance of the order date (19th Sept ordered, 29th expected delivery). Again no contact advising why. Apparently shipped today. Original order placed 7th September, a full month so far!Lets see what the print quality is like if it ever arrives. A couple of years ago the quality was terrible and the jerseys had to be sent back to be re-done. I would strongly suggest that you try to locate another vendor or order a long time in advance.

"Emily Moe","Welp, I would say ""I will try to keep this short"" but that's just not going to happen. I'm not a big ""review writer"" (never have wanted to devote my time to that), but I know how important they are and I rely on them greatly when making purchases (except this one time, evidently!). So since this experience was so poor for me, I figured I would do someone else the favor of giving a fair warning. Beware, this is a long read.This was my first time buying anything from Fanatics. We had bought tickets to a baseball game a couple weeks ago (that is set to occur in a couple of days), and we decided that we needed some new merch (to look fresh, of course). I had a couple of friends in the past who had ordered stuff from Fanatics, and honestly, they are the only thing that comes up on google when you search for sports merchandise. Seeing as we do not live local to our team, it is impossible to find anything in stores around here. So shopping online became my only option. I placed my order on Sept. 15th, with a shipping selection of 3 days (they had a free shipping promotion for that choice) so I figured that would leave enough time for the order to arrive by when I needed it on the 25th. Less than 2 days went by (the 17th, now) and I then got my ""your order has shipped!"" email. I was super excited because that was even sooner than I had anticipated. **Boy was I wrong**My order was compiled of 3 items: a mens sweater, a womens sweater and a childs t-shirt, all for my husband, our son and myself. Later in the day on the 17th, the same day I got the shipped notification, I received an ""expected arrival"" email for my items. The status now said that the items were being shipped in separate shipments and only one item had actually been shipped (my husbands sweater). The bad part is, the one item that had been shipped wasn't expected to arrive until the 29th. WHAT?? That would be 2 weeks from my order date, and wouldn't arrive in time for our game. I have had faster shipping turnaround from 'Shein', and that is saying something.Naturally, I was concerned. I had just paid a pretty penny for these items, just to not receive them within a week and a half when I needed them.. so I contacted customer service. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about the sweater that had already shipped, but could expedite (at no cost) the shipping of the other two items that would be shipped together, so I would have them in time. I still was confused as to why with the shipping method I chose, it was going to take that long. But the rep couldn't seem to give me an actual answer on that, so I dropped it. Of course I was bummed that I wouldn't get my husbands sweater in time (really just an inconvenience, seeing as now I would have to end up HOPEFULLY buying something else ) but I was at least relieved that I would have the other items. Well then it got worse. Four days after I had originally purchased (the 19th, now), I got a notification from my bank that a refund had been posted to my account from Fanatics. I was super confused and immediately went to check my email to see if I had missed something. Sure enough, I had just  got an email stating that they couldn't fulfill an item in my order (my sweater) and therefore had to refund the amount to me. AGHGHGHGGGH! So now that is TWO OUT OF THREE ITEMS that I am simply not getting on time/at all from my order. Four days have now passed and I am that much shorter on time to find another place that will have any of the items I want and ship them to me by the 25th. I was beyond annoyed.Again, I get ahold of customer service, and they basically said ""sorry we must have ran out of the item, but you should get the other item you ordered on time"". That seemed hard to believe at this point. So now we move to Monday the 20th, and I get a notification that I should receive the one item (my sons shirt) by Weds the 22nd. My husbands sweater still shows ""arrival on Sept 29th"" so I was pretty much giving up on that. Well, The 22nd comes and I receive a fanatics parcel in the mail. YAY! HAHAHA I was now even more confused because it was MY HUSBANDS SWEATER in the parcel and not my kids t-shirt. I am now beyond puzzled. I just got through chatting with yet ANOTHER rep, and they said they show that the revised SHIP date for the t-shirt wasn't until the 22nd (???), and as of now have no clue as to where it even is. She said if they cannot locate it by tomorrow, it is lost. I let her know, as nicely as possible, that I was upset with this whole ordeal. She then (LEGIT) left the chat. UM! Needless to say, that tipped me over the edge and led me here to write this review. As of now, I am SOL on having any merch for my son and myself, but I guess hubby lucked out, huh? I know every merch chain has issues, but to screw up an ENTIRE order is beyond me. Please, just do your research and think twice before using these guys unless you have to.

"Thomas","I just purchased a shirt for $37.99. The first time I washed it the decal started peeling off in the middle. Fanatics told me that they do not do exchanges or returns because it was a custom T-shirt. They also mentioned that it was not defective when I received it. It wasn't worth wasting my time trying to correct their logic. If you buy a shirt don't expect to be able to wash it, is what they're saying. Their solution was to send me a 20% coupon on my nest purchase. Obviously, I will never buy anything from them again so they don't need to worry about it. I used my credit card points for a gift card because I would never pay $37.99 for a T-shirt and I didn't have anything else to use the points on. Just so you know it's the quality of a $10 shiirt. I was contacted by Fanatics after they read my review. They made good on everything. I'm leaving it at 4 stars because the quality is not what you'd expect.

Can’t reach anyone it’s hard to find any info on how to reach them. This site is some HOT trash, I wouldn’t recommend if my life depended on it. Fanatics is Garbage. Still haven’t received my item.

This is a drop ship item and you cannot cancel or change the order in any way.   I asked when I would receive my order and she responded she wasn’t sur but that I would get an email when it was shipping.   I downloaded the live chat session and sent it to myself in a text.

After setting up a return I was told I would only be refunded $20.06 of the $47.64 that I spent! Thats a difference of $27.58!! Unreal.

"capncrunch","Terrible experience all around.  Applied a free shipping code, but then they automatically charged me expedited shipping because - in their opinion - it was ""the best value"".  Next time I go to the grocery store I hope they charge me for some groceries I don't want as well, because ""hey it's great value!""  Customer service said they would refund me for the shipping, but the email confirmation for the adjustment reflected $0.  Had to ask again to actually receive the refund.When the order finally shipped, it got lost. I've now been trying for days to get thru their chat customer service, and they keep giving me automated messages that say their customer service is too busy assisting other ""fans"".  Clearly these are fans of sports teams and not fans of fanatics, because there are so many people upset that they can't even get to us all after days of trying?  Maybe it's because customers have to contact customer service multiple times (if they can) and still not receive their order.

"Jeremy Tay","Fanatics is a joke and scam. I ordered my items on 22 Jul and it's website stated that my order will be delivered by 5 Aug. By 5 Aug, my order clearly didn't arrive and based on tracking information, it showed that the package was still stuck at the USA warehouse. I made a complain on 11 Aug and they said apparently my order had gotten lost on transit. Thereafter, they said they would re-ship my items but because one of my items had ran out of stock, I had to place a new order. Both items were now re-shipped on 16 Aug and based on their website, it stated the package would arrive by 30 Aug. AGAIN, as of 30 Aug- my packages are still stuck in the US warehouse. When I checked with their live agent through the chats, they apologised and said my items have unfortunately gotten lost in transit AGAIN.They try to paint the picture that they are very helpful through the live agent chat function but in reality, their agents are very deceitful and over-promise to try to paint themselves in a positive light. One example- on one occasion where I told the agent that my item will be delayed as based on tracking, it clearly showed that the item was still stuck in the warehouse- he said ""no worries I will issue a ticket for you and my colleagues will get back to you within 2-4 days"". After 1 week when I checked back on the chat, their agents said ""oh sorry the ticket submitted was not processed"". In the end, when the packages are lost, they don't offer any compensation and merely tell you to either ""accept a refund"" or accept another reshipping. It is just very very very bad customer service as if telling you to ""suck it up"".",2021-09-16,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

He understood my situation and explained he would do his best to rectify the situation. He got back to me that day with the return information and I was able to return the item thanks to Tyler.

Then they refund me saying out of stock yet it says in stock on website and ships within one business day!!!! To make it worse they didn’t refund me the full amount.  I got a discount on the caps, but the t-Shirt was excluded from all discount codes, yet they will not give me what they owe me despite me proving I payed the full amount for T-shirt.

I did not get an (auto-generated) response after my last email to Maribell (see below). Maribell advised me to send an another email and I did. This time, no (auto-generated) email or real reply. I will keep posting my updates so it does not get swept under the rug by all the ""positive"" reviews. Fanatics, please address this security and privacy concern. It is written in your privacy policy that we, the customers, can deactivate our account(s). I have sent a request via email two weeks ago and I have yet to receive a response. Your (auto-generated) replies to real concerns from real customers on TrustPilot are misleading. We are advised to send an email and a few hours later, all we get is an (auto-generated) email. Will a real person and employee of Fanatics actually address our questions and concerns? *****Updated: 08/04/2021 at 3:20PM (EST)As per Maribell's request, I sent an email, detailing my concerns regarding the site's security. Once again, I received the same (auto-generated) email, advising me to ""change my name"". If one has shopped on Fanatics' site, it is a known fact that the customer cannot modify or remove existing addresses in the address book. Why is this even an issue? Customers are not allowed to modify or remove their information? Where does it say in the privacy policy that we, the customers, cannot modify and or remove personal information, especially if the information is incorrect? It even states in the privacy policy that we can deactivate our account by sending a deactivation request. I sent an email last week, requesting Fanatics to deactivate my account and I have not heard back. If customers do not have the option to modify their accounts, the customer service agents should be able to, right? It does not make sense to me, and to others, that employees of Fanatics do not have access to customers' profiles for order-related or account-related issues. This should be brought to light and shared with corporate, to existing customers, and potential customers. *****Updated: 08/04/2021 at 11:30AM (EST)Email from Fanatics:""Thank you for reaching out. I apologize for any inconvenience regarding your account.You will need to log in to your account on our website. Once you do that, go to Profile and you will be able to make the necessary change to your name.We do not have access to your account to be able to make that change.If I have not resolved this matter to your satisfaction, please let me know how I can be of further assistance.""It is a security matter and this is the response that I get? Why is my last name incorrect? We are not talking about an incorrect spelling but a completely different last name from my own. There is no option for one to edit or delete an address. How can a company tell their customers or potential customers that they cannot assist them with anything, even with something minute such as editing or removing an existing address? How is this even possible? As I have mentioned in my previous post, I read Fanatics' privacy policy and I submitted an email to the email address provided in their privacy policy to deactivate my account. The privacy policy states: ""You may request that we deactivate your account at any time by contacting us at: (insert email address)."" I sent an email last week and I have yet to hear back. If a company does not adhere to their own privacy policy, conduct business with them at your own risk.*****Fanatics will not allow one to modify or delete addresses in the address book. I came across an address in my address book with a different last name from mine and I contacted customer service right away to advise them of the matter. All I got was something along the lines of, ""We will forward it to (insert 'department')."" I read their privacy policy and it states that one can deactivate their account by submitting an email to the email address listed on their privacy policy page on their website. I sent an email almost a week ago and I have not heard back. I do not understand why Fanatics will not allow their customers to modify their address(es) or even deactivate their accounts.

But now an issue, and i cant get a hold of anyone, via chat because it keeps saying: unfortunately were busy with other fans.....yada yada yada....i just want to know where my missing items are, got my other items but missing two?? and why it says shipped and they never came?? But again cant seem to get a hold of anyone, no email contact information? Got phone numbers off google, ill try em tomorrow i guess? Online chat is useless, its always busy......anyhow hopefully this gets resolved....i used paypal i mean i guess i could file a claim, but again i never had issues before with fanatics site...used about 4 times this year....spent about 500 plus in just last two months.....now i have missing items, its like oh great, can we trust?? and getting a hold of them is impossible.....ill try tomorrow to contact via numbers....if nothing i guess paypal only option left....dont want to pay for nothing.....Received email from fanatics stating they will be sending the two missing items. Have not received the confirmation email they mentioned, but hopefully soon. Either than that, hope all goes well, thanks.Late edit in a way.. date July 27 2021 time, 10pm exact, strangely.anyhow enough rambling.they shipped both missing items. Satisifed customer.

"Ng Ruenn Sheng","I bought stuff from the MLB Store and the Fanatics site  for a jersey, and got my order cancelled in both instances. Fortunately they are both refunded. I wanted to ship a jersey overseas (though not my billing address) and emailed Fanatics. I was then directed to call Fanatics. With so many chat options available why am I only given the option to call? Worse still, when I call Fanatics, I was asked to call the UK Fanatics site, which asked me to email. And when I emailed, I was redirected to email the USA Fanatics customer support, which then brings me to the same place: call USA Fanatics fan support hotline. Now who can I look for when my Fanatics account gets terminated and I can never, ever get to order stuff from Fanatics?",2021-07-08,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

Bought Aguero authentic shirt and it came back like crap bc an idiot who did name/number printing left it on too long. The shirt has wrinkles everywhere due to over heating and a clear visible separation. Asked for an exchange but no avail. After two months of chasing them like a cat, all I've got is 25% off extra on the shirt (will believe it when I see it). Now I'm left with a useless shirt, which I will neither wear or get signed. Will save the shirt with the tags left on and bring it to Manchester to prove to the dumbass management how incompetent they are.  Not surprising bc fanatics have a terrible reputation in the States.

I ordered an engraved Jacksonville Jaguars mug for my father. The arrival date was supposed to be 24Dec, that way I could gift it as a Christmas gift. After it being already 2 weeks past the original due date he finally received it. Upon arrival we realized that it was the wrong engraving! I contacted customer support and they said they would resend another and only rebate me back the cost of shipping. After another 2-3 weeks of waiting he finally received it and again it was the wrong engraving! I called them back again and was told they weren't able to make another due to them already sending us 2 of them. Instead they just gave me partial credit towards another item. I thought maybe it was the engravers fault so I proceeded to give them another chance. On the day of the 2021 NFL Draft I ordered a Trevor Lawrence jersey from them. I received it in the mail about 2 weeks later and opened it to find black scuff marks on my brand new $120.00 jersey! I called customer service once again and was told due to the jersey being sold out all they could do was refund the money or give me a discount. I made sure to be one of the first to order this jersey because I was afraid they would sell out. All they did was give me $30.00 back, which after S&H, I still basically paid $100 for a scuffed up jersey.

The first time the order was confirmed, but the card payment was cancelled a day later (typical Fanatics issue apparently). The 2nd time, it looked like the order went through (with Paypal) but I never received anything. After 6 weeks, they replied that the item was out of stock. How is that possible because the item was still listed in the store 6 weeks later. I am very stoborn, so a few months later, I tried again to order. And yes, for the 3rd time, the order was confirmed! But 3 weeks later it still hasn't shipped. They currently advertise the item that it ships in 1 business day. Really? Really?

Asked to speak to a supervisor - was denied.  Then she said, ""Anything else I can help you with,"" then hung up. Tried the online chat - same thing only worse.  Same rote script that she didn't deviate from and was no help at all.  She said have a library, supply store, or shipping company print out the return label the they would send me instructions.  Explained I lived in a small town with no library, office supply store or shipping company, nearest one is 60 miles away round trip. She said they would not take the return back if I didn't drive the 60 miles and get someone there to print out their label.  Not even my fault, gas over $4.00 gallon, yet I'm put out.

"Nash","This review concerns the European NBA store (nbastore.eu) which is driven by the company Fanatics UK.Short version of review: Do NOT buy from them! Terrible service with too long processing time, and a very low quality merchandise.Longer version of review:I ordered a jersey from one NBA player (i.e. it was not a custom print request) and it took them more than one month to send it to me, which is an unacceptably long time. I tried to contact customer service several times in the meantime, and each time they were comming up with new excuses. First they lied that the item was shipped, which was obvious lie because tracking link was saying that the order is being ""processed"" and not sent yet. Later they said that they need to ""re-send"" the item which caused additional waiting time. Then after more than one month of waiting, the item finally arrived.The jersey was packed unprotected and shipped in a cheap plastic bag, and all the prints appeared damaged and of low quality. The letters were almost falling off from the jersey. I will NEVER again buy from this store. I do not know how do they still have license to call themselfs an official NBA store.",2021-04-27,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Bobby L","Fanatics.com does not do exchange, they will ask you to return it and order a new one. But here's the thing, they will not return or give a full refund for your order. They will only return the amount of the item you ordered and the tax, but not the cost of shipping and handling. I was saving for my ever first jersey, I ordered a Jordan jersey for $255.10, it was bigger than I expected it so I planned to exchange it with a smaller size. I called them at their customer serivce number, and I was told to return it and order the item again. I ordered it using an eGift card for $250, they only returned $224.71. I have been contacting them for 3 weeks now to get a full refund of my order. Unfortunately, they can't return the handling I think but will return the shipping cost $11.99 for one time. I  was told they will create a ticket for the refund last week, and have to wait 2-7 days. I contacted again today, a ""fan advocate"" told me there was no ticket created. First told me that my refund ($11.99) will go back to one of the eGift cards that I used, and then the 2 last person talk to, told me it will go back to paypal. It's now 3rd week, no refund still either eGift cards or paypal. And contacted today, I was told to wait for an email within 24 - 72 hours. Frustrating experience getting my first jersey. If I knew, I could have sold it for $300 get $50 profit and get a new jersey. But at least they price match for the cost of the first order in case you used a coupon code but only within 15 days.

"Kevin Brinkley","No wonder this company has so many terrible reviews - they're awful. I don't know how they're still in business. So I received a Fanatics gift card as a Christmas gift. Finally decided to use it. I went to a smaller school, so I was surprised they had anything for it, so I ordered 2 items - a Carabiner keychain and a Tumbler. Both were shipped out separately, and I received the Tumbler first. When I opened it, I had been sent the wrong school. So I called customer service and complained. Not yet having received the keychain yet, I was skeptical. They said they would send me the right order as I made sure to point out that this school is not even remotely close to mine. Not close in the alphabet, no spelled similarly, hell, they're on opposite coasts of the US. Ok, a mistake? Fine. But then I get the new one today and would you believe it they sent me the same damn Tumbler? Unbelievable. My family member feels awful for even gifting me the gift card after all of this. And they won't attempt a third one. Apparently this is a common issue. I will return these two Tumblers and IF I get a refund to the gift card, will see if they'll just refund the balance in cash.

Haven't even received my items yet and there is 48 hour up to 65% off sale with free shipping. I called to ask if I would be able to get credit for the items I purchased that went on sale(every item I bought was on sale). It would have been a savings of $46.00. The customer service rep that I spoke to, Melanie, left a whole lot to be desired in the customer service department.  She was defensive, rude and at one point was yelling at me. At first she wouldn't honor the sale prices, only the free shipping, which I had already received anyway.  Then she offered me 10% off my total...all the items I purchased were at minimum 25% off with the sale prices, so I declined that offer.  She insisted she could not put in 2 codes at the same time.  She had a hard time comprehending that it was a SALE with a free shipping code, not two separate codes. She was awful to deal with. I asked for a supervisor and of course, there wasn't one on the floor.  This company is NOT worth the hassle. I should have purchased directly from the University and going forward will only do that.",2021-04-13,2,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Will Gassett Jr","I’m writing this because I don’t want people to make the same mistake I did. So I ordered a Boston Bruins Authentic Brad Marchand jersey from fanatics for $225 plus taxes and shipping, it happened to be on sale so I ended up getting it for less and therefore decided to pay for upgraded expedited two business day shipping because just like EVERYONE who orders stuff online I want it AS QUICKLY AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE, my opinion is they shouldn’t be allowed to charge you for it UNTIL IT SHIPS and maybe then they’d be more apt to SHIP YOUR MERCHANDISE IN A TIMELY MANNER, but no they TAKE THE MONEY IMMEDIATELY and then you’re left sitting there waiting. I do not like how they have their website set up in terms of they ask you about your preferences for shipping and it is only after you pay for it but they put a disclaimer up on the top of the screen talking about how shipping could be delayed supposedly because of “covid” which as far as I’m concerned it just a generic excuse that EVERYONE IS USING! So now I’ve ordered and paid for my jersey that was IN STOCK and they’re telling me I won’t receive it until APRIL 6TH!!! THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE! I am considering canceling the order and going thru another company (the one I should’ve gone to in the first place but I wanted to directly purchase it) because I know for a fact the other company will get me my jersey MUCH FASTER! I would AVOID FANACTICS AT ANY AND ALL COST, what’s discouraging is that THIS IS AN LICENSED DISTRIBUTOR OF NHL MERCHANDISE and for them to care so little and do absolutely NOTHING TO RESOLVE ISSUES has forced me to take my business elsewhere and it will be a VERY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF BUSINESS!",2021-04-03,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

On my first purchase from the new Fanatics-run Blizzard Gear Store the merchandise arrived damaged and it took over a month of back-and-forth emails -- literally -- until I gave up and asked for a lengthy email to be forwarded to supervisors giving a harsh critique... only then did they actually do anything and finally helped me.I decided to just now give them another chance and placed another order -- it was cancelled and they also deleted my account. Annoying, but I naively imagined it was a fluke with their fraud detection systems. Second purchase with a different payment method and everything also had the same outcome.I reached out to their phone support since the emails instructed me to do that. The system told me it would be 10 minutes; I decided to wait since I thought the wait time was reasonable. But at minute 8 the system said representatives were busy and hung up on me. Ah, now I remember why I stuck to emails back on the first order.Also, I tried their live chat. Same story: they're too busy so they won't even allow you to queue for the next customer support rep.You know what? I REALLY give up now for real. First they send damaged merchandise and now they won't even allow me to order. I guess Blizzard instructed Fanatics that they do not want their fans' money anymore because they sure are making it so hard. And I mean, look at this TrustPilot page for Fanatics... it is overwhelmingly 1-star. Who would even order from them anymore if this page were more visible. I should've written this review back on the first try and I think then it would've earned 2 stars from me because in the end they helped after a month of back-and-forths; now I'd give them zero stars if I could.I can count on one hand the number of companies I tell people to avoid like the plague. Sadly, Fanatics is now one of them. And I will point them to this page as evidence.2/20/20 Update:I naively reached out to the email as instructed in the reply of this review in the hopes of them helping out. The rep, Yasmine, while kind and professional, only proceeded to inform me of things that I already knew: that my order was canceled, that I would not be charged for the purchase, and to reach out the same phone number I tried calling in my review above. All of these seemed like canned replies and, again, information I already knew. Honestly, I no longer have the energy, time, or patience to try to get this company to accept my money.

Every single time I try to resolve/escalate the issue, no resolution is made and is only ‘escalated’ into another case. I feel very dissatisfied by the lack of service and zero communication.

The website makes it impossible to get any helpful info, the V.A. only gave specific topics as options to make inquiries.

This individual was rude, talked over me repeatedly and when I requested a refund said that she wasn't able to accommodate me. After requesting to speak with a Supervisor or someone who can assist with resolving this matter, I was placed on hold for approximately 3 minutes without being informed that I was being placed on hold mind you the rep. returned only to say she spoke with her superior and was told what I previously stated to you. Frustrated at this point I asked why would you speak with him/her I requested to speak with someone. I made the attempt to ask again to speak with who I requested, she continued to over talk me. I had to ask her which one of us is the customer and if management was aware of the unprofessionalism she displayed on that call. The woman stated that I'm done talking to you and ended the call while I was in mid sentence. This was honestly the worst experience I've had and the fact the took almost $300 immediately but it's been over a month and btw she also informed me that my order would be received until March.

"Eric Sky","I have placed this year different orders with Fanatics but two of those went very bad and that's the only reason why I leave this post.First one was during the year. I ordered different items but I was missing a t-shirt for 35€. Trying to get in contact with them is quite difficult and I gave up.At the end of the year, I place another order for 70€. I made the mistake to go on the German webside, being German and living in Spain, placed my order and just realised at the end that at the end of my Spanish address, figured DE. After a month without news and no tracking number, I called in the UK to get some updates. I was directly attacked that everything is my fault and that it would take 28 days to return. I told her once again, that I assume my mistake but that I was surprised that someone sends something out to Barcelona, Germany. Anyway, I waited another month and send an e-mail. I got a reply that everything is my fault and that they have no idea if it comes back. Of course I have to wait another month and they can't provide any tracking number. Doesn't help the cause but I do understand.I'm writing this post, not because I made a mistake and what happened but about the way they handle their business. They don't care and they make it feel you. That's probably why it's so difficult to reach them.I won't ever order again from Fanatics.

I didn't realize, but 1 of the shirts was removed from my cart when I was checking out (I guess it sold out before I could complete my purchase).   So, once the order was completed, I only had 1 shirt purchased.  In addtion, I was charged shipping (which site stated was ""Free"", also a handling charge of $1.99 (really? HARDLY ANY OTHER RETAILER CHARGES THIS!).  Lastly, the expected delivery was over 2 weeks away.  So, then I try to cancel the order immediately...no can do on the website.  I tried chatting online, all operators are busy.  I try calling which is over an hour wait...fine, I leave my number and I get a message stating they missed me (phone never rang).  Call back again, now over 1.5 hour wait...nobody calls me back until the next day.  That person took care of cancelling, but no empathy, no apology, just cancelled the order and done.  I was able to order from another site, which happens to also be a fanatics partner. That shirt shows it should be here next week, we'll see.

I checked the website again after ordering and Ovechkin was there! So I ordered the OV authentic and called fanatics to cancel the original order. I waited on hold for 1 hour and 15 minutes before someone was able to assist me. She then informed me that I was past the 30 minute cancellation window and they would need to expedite the order to another team to process the request. She assured me since the order was just placed and their “call waiting line” was the reason for me missing the cancellation that there wouldn’t be an issue completing it. I received an email just now from a chat window stating they will not be able to cancel the order and hope they have my business again in the future. This is ridiculous!!! Just cancel the order, it was customized for Ovechkin and his number, not like it was a unique name. AND I already made the other purchase through you all so you have my business.

One item I bought was a Santa with the Blackhawks logo it was a cheap rubber Santa with a sticker on it. It looks like a dog toy and they charged me 20.00. I tried looking up to see what happened to my order and they kept saying my order was not found. Could not find anyway to actually contact a person all I got was a computer that just told me it could not find my order. If you need sports stuff don't shop here not only is this site overpriced for cheaply made stuff but apparently you buy things at your own risk because you just don't know if your order will show up or not.

When you follow the online instructions to return, they give you a return label for each item. NO WHERE does it say that they will charge you $10 for each returned item and NO WHERE does it say you can use your own labels or return them in the same package. I received a refund for .77 for the shirt and contacted customer service and only then was I informed of their $10 return label price for each item. After a couple emails back and forth- they stopped responding. I still have not received a refund for the table. I do not recommend you buy from this website.

"Pam Ballas","Beware of their 365 day return policy!!!  Ordered a gift for someone for Christmas - it was too big and when I tried to return they said I was outside of the 30 day window.   Since my item was drop shipped from the manufacturer the return had to be done in 30 days from the date shipped (not the date I received it) However, this was never indicated on my order, the confirmation email or on the invoice that came with the merchandise.   Seems very deceptive.Update 1/27/21- after responding to my negative review, Fanatics finally allowed me to return the merchandise and sent me a return label at no cost.   It is unfortunate that it had to be elevated to this level in order to be allowed to return but I'm thankful for their response.   I still think the 30 day return policy on manufacturer direct shipments should be more prominently displayed in the checkout so that the customer can be alerted before they place the order.   When ordering for Christmas, a 30 day return can be quite difficult since you sometimes have to order a month in advance to get the item you want to give someone.",2021-01-22,3,"Trust Pilot",NA

I can tell you, from experience, it is well over an hour (the point at which I give up).Issue 2: The callback system is broken.

We have different phone types (Samsung and Apple) which are on different carriers (Bell and Telus) so, no, this isn't a problem on our side.

It says in the site  that my items should arrive by Dec 14, 2020. Nothing received by Christmas, nothing received by new year. I emailed them before Christmas to request a status, no one emailed back except the automated response that they received my email and someone will get in touch with me, which no one did. Anyway I emailed them again first week January, same thing, no reply. I emailed them third time, and said I will file a case in Pay Pal. Finally someone emailed me to ask for my order details. I provided it to them, and they said they will send a replacement. I told them that was supposed to be Christmas present, and asked just to refund my money. No one contacted me since then and just received another automated email saying that they have dispatched the item. Very poor customer service and pathetic site , they didnt even bother offering any sort of apology or compensation.Incidentally, I ordered some NBA products from NBA store as they were more expensive in Fanatics.com, I ordered same time, and these orders arrived before Dec 14 , 2020.

I ordered a fire pit for a Christmas present in Nov 2020.  The company advertises easy returns 365-Days.  The person I purchased the fire pit for is not interested in the product.  The box has never been opened.  I contacted Fanatics to return the fire pit and they informed me that the product is over 30 days and I am unable to return the product.

This Christmas I spent over $400 and when trying to return my items after Christmas with them (their website says 365 day returns) One item says direct manufacturer and its past 30 days cannot return (seriously I ordered it for Christmas so yes it was over 30 days ago) Then I send 3 items back this week totally over $100 and I get an email today that a $17.99 shirt was received and I was credited $4.42 When you call the phone # it is all automated you cannot reach a person.

Fanatics reached out to me and tried to make this right.  They reshipped the item but it was still not what was advertised.

"A.D.","Fanatics.com is terrible. I remember having bought from them long ago and I didn't have problems with them, but it seems that growth and/or ambition has turned them into a horrible piece of garbage as a company.About a month ago, I decided to buy two NFL jerseys from them because they were both on sale at a very good price. The first upsetting surprise came in the process of completing the order, where I saw that not only do they charge shipping, they also charge handling, which a little pop-up message on the page explained was to pay for warehouse costs. It is incredibly stupid that a company charge me an additional fee for something which is part of their regular operating costs and should be coming out of their profit margin.However, since the overall price for both jerseys was still good and within my budget, I ordered them anyway. The shipping cost was for 7-14 days shipping. It is now 29 days since I made that order, and not only has the order not arrived, the Fedex tracking for the order has not updated at all in 18 days!!!Last week I decided to try their website's online chat for customer service, since they basically provide no other method whatsoever to contact them. I spent about 20 minutes waiting for someone from their staff to log; then the chat said an agent logged on, but they did not write a single word at all. I was waiting for about another 10 minutes, and then I was simply kicked off the chat without any prior notice and without ever receiving a single word from their staff. Quite frankly, it felt like a humongous ""f*** you"" from them as a company to me as a customer. They already had my money so they didn't give a flying f*** about me getting my order.Digging around through the links at the bottom of the website a couple of days ago to try to find another method of contact, I managed to find a link to their corporate website where I actually found a way to send them an e-mail about this order. I just checked my e-mail a few minutes ago and there is no response from them.Needless to say, I will now be taking this matter to other channels. The delivery estimate from Fedex said December 25th, and while I understand there have been shipping delays during the holidays, there are several orders from independent eBay sellers which I have made well after this Fanatics order and they have already arrived. Since Fanatics doesn't seem to have any intention of taking care of their customers (nor does Fedex, but that's a whole other matter), and since they can't seem to fulfill their orders at the same level as a sole individual on eBay, I guess I'll have to turn to other entities to get my money back.Bottom line... give very serious consideration before buying from Fanatics. They don't seem to know what the hell they're doing, and they certainly don't care at all about their customers, either. All the sports leagues in the U.S. and around the world should start looking for a different sales partner for their merchandise.",2020-12-28,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Paul Franklin","On December 8, I ordered the jersey from my daughter’s favorite baseball team as one of her main Christmas presents. I live in a rural area and there is no home delivery of mail; everything goes to a PO Box, although the street address is used by UPS for its deliveries. I used the PO Box address when ordering the jersey. NOTHING in the website said that PO Box addresses couldn’t be used. On December 23 I got an email from fanatics.com: (1) saying that the shipper (OnTrac) couldn’t deliver my package because they didn’t deliver to post office boxes; and (2) asking for my street address. I sent back my street address literally the moment I finished reading their email, which was less than two hours after they sent the email. On December 26, I hadn’t heard anything back from them or from the shepherd. I called the shipper. They told me that fanatics.com had transposed the first two digits of my street address (thus creating a non-existent address), that the package was undeliverable and had already been returned by the shipper to fanatics.com. I called fanatics.com. I told the customer service rep (from another country) that what I wanted them to do was send me, by next day delivery, the jersey that I had ordered 2 ½ weeks before Christmas, an order that the company made at least three independent mistakes on. After being placed on hold for almost 15 minutes, I was told that the only thing the company could or would do was give me a refund, which would be processed hopefully 7 to 10 business days after the shirt was received by them. My daughter is a hard-core fan of our local team, but if fanatics.com was the only source of baseball-related items, I would tell her to forget about baseball and become a curling fan. For absolute certain, I will never do business with fanatics.com again.",2020-12-28,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"K Durham","I ordered an XL Dodgers 2020 World Series Champion sweatshirt from Fanatic ""International"" as a gift for my son. Upon opening the gift, my son immediately recognized the sizing is more like a large, the print quality is a poor iron on job, and the overall quality of the garment was poor when compared to the XL 2020 Dodgers Champion sweatshirt (made by '47) that I previously purchased in person at Dick's Sporting Goods. Since the sweatshirt didn't fit my son, and he was not pleased with the poor quality, I tried to process the return.  On the Fanatics ""International"" website, I was sent to a ReBOUND return service which required me to enter my order number and/or zip code/email/phone number.  I entered my order number and email and ReBOUND did not recognize my order.  I tried entering my order number and zip code, as well as my order number and phone number, none of those worked either.  I know for a fact that the order number is correct as it was listed on my invoice, and I was able to enter the order number to track shipping status on the Fanatics ""International' website.  With all the failed attempts trying to use the required ReBound service, I tried to reach out to Fanatics ""International"" for a response, both via email, and messenger.  As of this writing, now in the 2nd day, I have heard nothing.  Who conducts business like this? I am also amazed that there is no way of contacting a customer service department via phone!  I guess my next move is to file a report with the Better Business Bureau.  It's pretty amazing that something as simple as producing a quality product or a Return, is so arduous.

I have bought from Fanatics plenty of times and the last time we did and exchange and charged us for the return so we could purchase the correct size. I also think their items fit one size smaller. For other buyers, order a larger size so you don't get charge a return fee. Previously, Fanatics reached out to me and waived the fees. I thought the charges were by mistake, but apparently not because I need to do another exchange but is charging me $9.99 to return.  I don't see why I would have to pay to return especially if I want to repurchase the correct size. I'll be returning the item and buying the right size elsewhere.  Fanatics has lost my business.

"Samuel Frick","For Christmas, I got a Fanatics Pittsburgh Penguins yellow T-Shirt and a Fanatics Vegas Golden Knights jersey. For the t-shirt, it fits me so well and I love it so far. As far as the jersey is concerned, I was a lot more pessimistic about it leading up to the order because I have heard a lot of crap about them. I’ve been lucky to have had a Reebok CCM Adidas and now a Fanatics. Of these four kinds of jerseys, fanatics are my least favorite but I do think they’re pretty solid jerseys. Granted. It doesn’t quite have the quality and performance Adidas has, but I think they look really good and are quite comfortable. The only downsides with a Fanatics are there is a minor but noticeable crease on the crest of the jersey, but that seems to be everyone’s issue with those jerseys, and I don’t like the shoulder patches in contrast to the ones from other jersey brands. Plus I do think they’re a little overpriced but it’s typical pro sports merchandising; so what’s new? But, for people that think Fanatics is complete garbage, I can’t say that’s exactly true. I guess it depends on each buyer’s experience. I guess mine was made really well. Hopefully, others have that same experience. For T-Shirts and hoodies, I definitely prefer Fanatics. However, I still prefer Adidas fanatics just because they’re worth the extra money and the quality is a bit better on those jerseys at that value than a fanatics at $100+. Otherwise, I suggest trying to find a Reebok, CCM, or any other jersey if it’s at the right price and it’s legit. However, if it’s not financially feasible to buy an Adidas or you’re just a casual fan, then Fanatics is a very solid choice. Just pay attention to what you’re ordering.",2020-12-26,4,"Trust Pilot",NA

So i LIGHTLY rubbed my thumb in the middle of one of the numbers and the it pilled right off.. so i was pissed put my hand over the whole number and the whole 8 came off. Also paid 75$ for a hoodie. Preds hoodie and this junk was as thin as paper. After the first wash you could see almost threw it. None of the fabric from the inside was left. Was all inside my drier. In april i seen a nice 49erd training camp shirt. White t with a red and black sf. When i got it the black was faded and the red was almost a pink color. After 1st wash i notice in the logo was white spots in it. It was just the shirt behind the logo cause this one was flaking off. SO THIS YEAR i got a 30$ gift card. I have 5 fav teams. For ever one i couldnt find NOTHING worth buying for 30. So FINALLY was going to get a long sleeve 49ers shirt. The total was 30.9 cents. So thought ok in the morning ill order it.

The remaining items shipped today and according to the FedEx website they will be delivered tomorrow. I contacted FedEx about the first shipment and was told the item was still in pre-shipment so I contacted fanatics and they said they could reship the items or refund them. I explained I needed them by Thursday December 24th as promised and was told that wasn’t going to happen. The rep then stated that once it was with the carrier it was out of their hands so basically their “guarantee” is crap (I’ve saved the conversation if anyone would like to see this fabulous customer service firsthand) mind you FEDEX haven’t received the items yet. The rep asked again if I wanted it reshipped or refunded I said I wanted it reshipped and a partial refund for their “false advertising” to which the rep said “I can refund $14.99 which is the cost of shipping which you never paid anyway” I found this extremely condescending but asked to keep the order as is in hopes FedEx gets the order and by the grace of God still makes it on time to which I never received a reply.

Again, no reply to the email either so I called on the same day as I felt very anxious about it not arriving in time for Christmas. I called and was assured that YES, they were in the warehouse being packaged and I would received as early as Friday (18th December). Satisfied with the information I was told I was certain I would be receiving it over the weekend. However, I received no dispatch email and today (Monday 21st December) I called again, only to be told that NO the item was out of stock, they never had it is the warehouse to be sent out and that I would not receive my item and was offered a refund. SERIOUSLY? 2 whole months since I placed my order, only for 4 days before Christmas telling me it is out of stock and I wouldn't receive it at all, let alone before Christmas. The customer service, organisation skills and false information given by this organisation is truly disgraceful. I have been told a pack of lies from day 1. I did not receive a single email back in response to any of the emails I sent, I was told false information when I called and their live chat has never ever worked. Terrible, terrible company.

They did everything wrong and it was completely their fault but somehow I get nothing from this experience. I called hoping to get a replacement, but the item was out of stock as well as the person I spoke with was very rude and unhelpful. He said his name was ""Daniel"" and when I asked for a last name he specifically said ""I am not giving you my last name"" in a rude manner.

I have long wanted to replenish my collection of gloves with an autograph of Mike and found them on the site, I also found an autograph of an equally outstanding Sugar which was on discount. I made order and paid by PayPal and was hoping to get them about Christmas but they have another plan. A few hours later, I received an email with a cancellation message and it also said that we cannot discuss order details via email. I kept my calm and just decided to call them to Fan Protection Specialist.  And then the fun began! Before getting through to Fan Specialist, I had to be really patient, waiting about 10 - 15 minutes and I get an answer on the other end. Standard questions like what is in the order, which amount, email, etc. and after that she disappeared, I waited about 10 minutes, no idea why so long, thought it was technical problem and hung up. I tensed, but I still wasn't going to give up, because I have long wanted these autographs for myself. I called the second time and again I wait about 10 minutes and there is no answer, I call back and the same thing and then I couldn't resist and thought to hell. They unjustifiably canceled my order!!!  I don't like to give advice when they don’t ask me about it, in this case I will give a recommendation, if you respect yourself then don’t waste your time on them, find another place and buy it there, albeit a little more expensive, but they will value and respect you as a valuable client. 2 years ago it was a different store, I don't know what needs to happen for me to ever return to them.P.S.

From this I took that my order would arrive well in time for Christmas. However, my email states that my order will not arrive until Dec 28th. I also think it is unfair that I had to pay £4.95 for delivery on a product that is already £99, never mind it due to arrive extremely late. To add to this, I have just gone back on the website and added another exact of the item I have ordered and it states “Get it by Xmas”. I am confused as to how someone who may order a week before Christmas can have their order in time whereas I will not receive mine having ordered 2 weeks in advance. I have emailed and filled in a form on the Fanatics website and I am still awaiting a reply. After reading a few complaints on here, I noticed someone got hold of them via Twitter.

I asked for the supervisor, and I was on hold for 40MINUTES JUST TO ""FIND THE SUPERVISOR"". Then when I FINALLY got off hold, she said she's transferring me to her supervisor. Her supervisor's phone rings, then says ""voicemail is full, goodbye"" and hangs up.

"Richard W","This is absolutely bizarre what is going on with this company and their website as of today (12/11/2020), it's as if I am searching two different websites under the same umbrella, sort to speak. When I enter the main page, there is one promotion that is available on the main page but then when you log into your account, another promotion suddenly takes center stage and on top of that, I had three items that were most readily available just an hour or so ago, but then after coming back to the site later on to use my e-gift cards for, it's as if a whole new site just popped up AND all the items I wanted to get have suddenly sold out or went out of stock. Tried to converse with their inept customer service department and they were absolutely clueless when it came to them to try and explain what had happened and not eve offer a proper apology for the commotion caused and for the website's ineffectiveness. Stay as clear away from this company as you can as you'd be better off paying a tad more for your sporting goods items than doing business with a joke of a company such as this! They seriously need to get their act together and when you call them out on something and even prove it to them, they claim that you're using foul language on them. What a joke of an organization they've become and you cannot even get a hold of them properly. No excuses for such nonsense happening!UPDATE 1: Karmen, you better believe I will e-mail you and a few others in the corporate sector to get to the bottom of this as to why items were readily available an hour or so ago, only for the entire site to change completely an hour later and most items now are missing or [suddenly] sold out on your site and dealing with rude customer service to boot. I have also alerted your top management team, including the CEO and chairman, to let them know what is going on here! This is just ridiculous & inexcusable!UPDATE 2: Just heard back from one of the corporate team members at Fanatics and he was very kind and gracious and is going to help me try and get the items I originally ordered via other means, so will keep y'all posted on the very latest on this situation.UPDATE 3: I am happy to report that someone from corporate took very good care of me this morning (12/12/2020) and I'm very glad I had other contact information handy, because the generic e-mail that some of these CSRs are listing on here is leading nothing more to an automated format letter but I was taken care of by corporate and it just takes a little effort and patience to get things done when it comes to this company, so all's well that ends well here.",2020-12-10,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"James Kang","I ordered an authentic Stephen Curry Warriors Jersey, and twice they sent me the swingman version of it, which is around $140 less than an authentic version.  I had called Customer Service 3-4 times and have been told several different stories.  First time they tell me that someone will call me back within 24 hours to make sure I get the right item.  Wait the next day, no call, I call them back and then hear that an agent with my ""ticket"" will call me back actually 2-4 days.  NO call back.  So I call them again, and they say my ticket was ""resolved"" with just sending me a return label with no desire to send me the right item.  So essentially I was told 3 or 4 different things and that I have to reorder, when in reality I can't because it's sold out now.2 things, 1) please make sure that what they are sending you is the right item if it's something like a Jersey.  I am starting to feel like some crooked things are happening where Fanatics is hoping that people won't know the difference since the items look ""similar"" enough and they jack a customer out of $140.2) make sure to just call them and connect them to someone who can help you directly.  Don't let them say they will call you back, they never will.I would hate to try to order from Fanatics again, but I think they just have a monopoly on these kinds of items with the sale prices they offer.

Well not for this company, I got an email ""accepting"" my return and stating that my refund should be reflected in my account within 10 days....2 months later, still no refund. I contacted customer support through email and was told that my refund was processed and I should check my statements....of course, I had already checked my account and NO refund was posted....to me, this is a way for this company to keep peoples money b/c I'm sure most people don't realize they haven't been refunded.  I then called customer support and was told that my account wasn't refunded and that they instead issued an egift card which I never received after about 45 minutes on the phone, the agent said he would ""escalate"" the issue. A day later I received an email with the egift card, however when I went to use the egift card, the balance was $0 - NO money was on this ""egift card""....I placed another call and had to explain the entire chain of events again....the customer agent ""escalated"" the issue again and told me someone will contact me in 3-4 business days!  Seriously, this company should be shut down....needless to say, I will NEVER order from this company again!

I just wanted to know what happened to the order I placed a month ago. I still wanted the items. Now the rep said I can call and speak to someone but I have no time for that.

"Matt Kunz","I ordered a NY Giants jersey from the site and was honestly very excited about it.  The item finally arrives and let me just say - I’ve seen better quality knock-offs out of China.  For $180 I received a jersey with poorly stitched/fraying numbers, the jersey was half iron on and had stitched patches, the NFL flash that sits in the crest of the neck was so off-center that it overlapped the seam joining the collar and mesh fabric of the jersey together by nearly a quarter inch.  Just the shoddiest of workmanship. I contacted customer service for a return as fanatics has this 365 day return policy (it sounds great to the uninitiated, but you find out otherwise quickly) to request a return label.  During the call the CSR and I discussed how I’d like the refund to be processed, giving me an option of store credit or a refund to the card processed.  I opted to have the money refunded to my original means of payment and went about my day.  Nearly ten days later, no refund had posted.  So I contacted customer service and that CSR told me to give it 48 hours and if it hadn’t posted yet to give them a call back.  72 hours later I fire off an email asking about my refund.  Within 15 minutes I receive a matter of fact email from some nameless employee that they refunded me on a gift certificate that they e-mailed me.  Now I’m sure you’re thinking - how did you miss an email like that?  Well, two reasons.  One, I had received an email already from them acknowledging the refund and that it would be applied to my card and reason two being that Fanatics literally sends anywhere from 4-7 emails, EVERY SINGLE DAY.In any event, despite all of this, Fanatics still didn’t issue a refund.  I’ve now filed a dispute with my bank and pissed and moaned on the BBB website.  If you have money to burn on sports memorabilia, avoid these bloodsucking pieces of $h*t.Edit: I see that Fanatics has responded.  I’m not sure how to respond to their response so I will simply update here - do you understand how, as a consumer, hearing “reach out to customer service” as a response after I posted this review because of the problems I had with your customer service is incredibly frustrating and only exacerbates the idea that you don’t really give a damn about my issue?",2020-12-04,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

Today is 12-3-2020 and the order shipping date has been changed 3 times. This is absolutely Unacceptable especially since they are located in Jacksonville Florida and the SEPTEMBER BIRTHDAY PRESENT was shipping to Tennessee. I spoke to several incompetent and untruthful advocates who read the teleprompter in front of them and it was all misleading. I’m not sure if the NFL Shop has turned their heads and rolled over  concerning Fanatics deceptive Ordering and Shipping practices, but, today they are put on notice again. I’ve ordered many items over the years and I’m appalled at the lackadaisical attitude I’ve encountered on my LAST and FINAL order with this company. I’m so glad that I decided against purchasing 3 of the T-shirts because I would have been thoroughly upset if my 11-30 birthday would have come and gone and NO present. I don’t  want a refund, I want the birthday gift for someone who is has been extremely ill shipped before SEPTEMBER 2021, please! Be careful and think before you place an order with Fanatics because their ordering and shipping practices are no longer reputable and very deceptive.To Julian,The response hasn’t changed over the last few months and Fanatics still aren’t taking ownership of the situation.

The 30% off offer on the next order is not acceptable because why would I continue to purchase products that are of bad quality from a business who don't stand behind their customers. If I wanted a sweatshirt that the letters were going to wash out of I would draw on it myself.

"Mike Boekestyn","Poor customer service, very frustrating trying to get a hold of someone. I order a Cheifs Salute to Service jersey which I never received. I receive an email on Saturday 11/21 saying it was out for delivery only to never receive the item. Upon further review on Monday I am told it was undeliverable because no one was there and it is being returned to sender. What a poor service provider not to attempt a second delivery or move it to a holding location for several days. Just shipping it back to the sender shows you dthey don't care about the customer.  What makes me furious is that the jersey is no longer available in my size so there is no option to get another one shipped. I will find my memorabilia elsewhere and never purchase from this company again",2020-11-23,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Gareth Humphreys","I completed an order earlier this month with a 30% discount code.My confirmation provided estimated dates for delivery but there are obviously issues due to the current situation.I contacted the help desk via chat and was told that nothing had been dispatched because one item was out of stock (it wasn't when I ordered it and I was never told it was out of stock, and funnily enough its still showing as in stock) meaning my order would be delayed.I was told that due to a system error the items in stock (3 of them) where held pending and couldn't be sent. I asked if the 'out of stock' item could be cancelled but was told I would have to cancel everything and reorder but not with my original discount. I asked when the item would be in stock to be told it would be on or by the 7th December. So I said to keep the order and the chat ended. That night I got an email cancelling my order, frustrated but willing to reorder I contacted the chat line to get the 30% discount code to be told no I can have 25% and free postage. I cannot understand how an order cancelled in error by the company, not me, means that I can reorder with a less discount. One point that annoyed me was that I was told in a condescending manner it was good that it had been cancelled as I wouldn't have got the order by march 2021.The people I spoke to on the chat where, in the main ok, despite one assistant adding a lovely exclamation mark to emphasise I can only have 25%. Of note the website has a 20 and 25% offer on anyway.'A discount order can only be used once' i was told, but it hasn't been used, I tried to use it but the company cancelled my order.I've already emailed the customer service team, not heard anything.",2020-11-23,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Callingya Out","Update 3 (Dec. 6): Just as I suspected, Fanatics is still playing games. Fanatics did issue refunds, but deducted the cost of the return. Per one of the responses today: ""We typically do not refund your original shipping charge unless an error has been made on our part.""  I qualified how sending me 1) poor quality goods and 2) goods not as described meets their ""unless an error has been made on our part"" criteria. They responded within the hour that they are offering to issue me an e-gift card for the amount of $9.99. I declined stating I had no intention of doing business with Fanatics or their affiliates in the future to use that e-gift card. They then responded insisting having already issued a $10.00 credit which would meet the obligation of having refunded the full amount.  I responded that this claim to a $10.00 refund that Fanatics issued Sep. 16 does not show on my statement. They then responded that they issued a $49.19 refund on Nov. 29. I responded that $49.19 does not list on my statement and this claim to having issued a refund for this amount has not been mentioned in any of the 17 previous emails.So basically the tactic Fanatics is engaged in is that by throwing in inaccurate/fabricated claims, the convoluted dialog wears-down a customer. I can see in my card account when returns post to my account. Fanatics is a business and all businesses track income and expenses, so I asked that they provide me proof of all refunds issued to my card account on this order.Update 2: Fanatics sent two return labels for the hoodie to be sent in one bag and the tee to be sent in a second bag when they both arrived together.  They accepted the return of the tee after I provided picture proof of the silkscreen defect.  I brought the return inefficiency to their attention which got a reply about the destinations.  Non-applicable since they both went to the same warehouse in NV.  Parcels in the mail Nov. 28.  Awaiting to see if either label usage incurs a cost to me.Update 1: As of my posting this, Fanatics responded to the post (as anticipated) and requested I email customer service.  Already did this prior to their response to this post.Original Post: The Fanatics/ FRG*TEAMFANSHOP JACKSONVILLE FL return policy states “returns 365 days a year.”  No details. Upon receiving my ordered college hoodie and tee, I saw the red color of the hoodie was more of an Alabama Crimson Tide and bigger than Youth XL. --Basically, goods not as described. The tee, while long for a petite person, looked as described; however, after one wash the silkscreen flecked off/ cracked. I emailed customer service and was provided a return label.  Caveat: If I use their label, I'm consenting to forfeit $9.99 to cover the return charge for goods that were not as described nor good quality. Nowhere in the purchasing process, in the post-transaction process, in the confirmation emails or on the website is this little detail. I took this to my card company. First dispute: Fanatics/ FRG*TEAMFANSHOP JACKSONVILLE FL responded by stating the goods were delivered. Yeah; they would have to be delivered for me to see they were not as described nor good quality.  Second dispute: Fanatics/ FRG*TEAMFANSHOP JACKSONVILLE FL responded with the order invoice. They sent to the card company a replication of the invoice listing the hoodie and tee.  OK; yeah, these two items I purchased and received were not as described.  The hoodie had ""Youth XL"" on it.  Invoice detail matched what was printed on the hoodie; however, I have been disputing that their website lists Youth XL as 36.5 -38 cm (chest). What I received was 48 cm (chest) and I had provided a picture of the hoodie with measuring tape showing it to be wider than the specs online. I also had provided a picture of a hoodie I already owned next to what Fanatics shipped which showed what was received was the wrong red by standard of what I bought at the college bookstore.  Again, items received not as described.I originally sought to have Fanatics/ FRG*TEAMFANSHOP JACKSONVILLE FL make this right by sending me a return label whereby they pay for items delivered that are not as described and poor quality, that they incur the costs associated to a refund, and they refund the full amount for selling goods that were poor quality and not as described. Just waiting for them to refund the balance for my last stipulation to be met (refund the full amount for selling goods that were poor quality and not as described).What I'm seeing on Trustpilot is that the seller monitors posts and responds. They don't stop deflecting though. The patterns I see in our posts here are business-in-bad-faith and drawing-out the dispute process to fatigue consumers.",2020-11-22,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

I ordered a jersey for my girlfriend as a gift, but I ordered the wrong size after seeing the sizing chart and called to change it moments after placing the ordee. Since it was a ""custom"" order the employee on the phone told me they could not change the order. (Keep in mind this jersey had the same name and number as an athlete on the team, it's only custom because it is in women's size) I asked if I would be able to return it when I got the jersey and they said yes. So I ordered the correct sized one and planned to return the incorrect one when I got it. I emailed them the day it was delivered and they said they don't accept returns or exchanges for ""custom"" orders. So, I made a mistake, but that was the worst customer service experience Ive ever received. I was lied to, and they would not even try to work with me for an exchange.*UPDATE*After posting my review, Fanatics customer service reached out to me and helped me out with a refund.

I did not understand why this was, seeing as when I clicked the back button and went back to the product listing, it clearly showed the item with the advertised promo price.

The shirts were the correct size and as pictured. :) In one shirt the fabric composition differed slightly (heavier fabric than the other 3 and felt like better quality) but perhaps that was specified in the description only I didn’t notice.

Firstly, the email addresses me as Dominic. This isn't my name. My name is in the email address I sent the support from, it's in the email address used to make my order, and it's probably on the order as well. I emailed asking about the status of my order, as the cost was refunded without me asking, however the shipping cost was not. The support rep completely ignored the first bit of my email and just gave me a copy-paste response about the shipping cost.",2020-11-06,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

It's not even close to purple. It's very disappointing to spend money and not receive what you see on the site. I'm in agreement with an early review someone posted, this particular store's merchandise is not what it use to be.  I'm giving an update to this review, today 11/17/2020, if you notice below this review Fanatics responded with this generic email, ""Oh no, send us an email with your order info blah blah"" well I did just that and my email came back saying this company will not authorize your email to be accepted blah blah. Honestly who cares!!! So, they respond as if they do good business but needless to say they aren't going to really do anything. Where I come from that's known as being fake, phony, fronting, scam and a bunch of other words I really want to use but won't out of respect to readers. I don't want any money back from this purchase, I just want people to know to be careful what you order from them and filter your choices to be only from Nike because that stuff usually looks pretty good.

"Terry Rodgers","Absolutely the worst company to ever order online delivery. I have ordered from this company a few times and only twice have ever received what I ordered. The most recent was October 20th 2020 when my 3-year-old son picked out a Denver bronco beanie. After a few days the tracking number stated that it had been delivered to my front porch. I then called customer service and told them that I had not received the order. The lady on the phone stated that the tracking number was for when it had been delivered to the post office and not my address??? She stated that after having been delivered to the post office then it would be delivered to my mailbox. So today I called customer service again and he told me that it had been delivered to my front porch almost 10 days ago. When I asked him about what the lady I talked to before said about it being delivered to the post office he said he had never heard of that before. He then stated that he could replace it and would send me another one. After waiting on the phone for a few minutes he came back on and said they no longer have that product in stock and it will never be back in stock. So now I have a 3-year-old that picked out something he wanted online and because of the incompetence of the company that I ordered from we will not receive that product.

I paid for expedited shipping as the order was a birthday gift for my Fiancé, and to my knowledge my order was going to be delivered before the 28th of October which would be two days before the birthday. Fast forward to today, tracking info has still not updated and the UK partner delivery company has still not received the package and I cannot contact the American delivery company as conveniently, only Fanatics can make enquiries as to its whereabouts. I am now unsure whether I need to panic-buy an alternative gift and accept that the package has been lost or hold out for Fanatics to give me any updates, which, given all of the other reviews, is incredibly unlikely.

"Mudlap","UPDATE: as suspected, after just the third washing (inside out as instructed) the graphic is cracking and flaking off.  Worst quality possible, so disappointed.I’m not much of a “sports guy” but I have a lot of long sleeved t-shirts and I’ve gotta tell ya, this is one of the lowest quality shirts I’ve ever gotten. Let me start by saying that the shipping was insanely fast, especially for a customized shirt.  Most of my t-shirts tend to be music or simply brand related.  First, I’ve never even seen a long sleeved t-shirt that didn’t have a ribbed cuff.  Looking back, the picture clearly shows it, but I didn’t know such a thing existed, my fault I guess, but the real problem is with the low grade graphic application.  It’s nothing more than a cheap heat application and I was worried it wouldn’t even stand the test of the first wash.  Second is the color integrity.  The Miami Dolphins logo is aqua/white/orange (that color combo is the main reason I ordered this shirt) but what I got is very clearly not aqua, as much as it’s almost dark blue and white on an orange shirt.  I had it personalized so I couldn’t return it.

"Michael Kaplan","This could have been a great experience but, of course it was not.  I was lucky that I have not spend any of my own money at Fanatics.  I received a $50 gift card to Fanatics.  I thought this is great, I can order some logo wear from my university.  I ordered a ball cap (fit perfectly and looks just like the picture on the website).  I also ordered a long sleeve t-shirt from Champion in 100% cotton.  Because I ordered on a day where they had free shipping, I was able to order the shirt and hat with $1.24 left over.  I therefore did not complain about the $1.99 handling charge.  This is there business, on line shopping and every order must be handled, so why the extra charge.  When I received the shirt (in a size that ALWAYS FITS) and the site said ""true fit"" I expected it to fit... it did not.  It was at least a full size too small.  I went to return it and they expected me to pay for return shipping, I said NO.  I was issued a return label and was told there would be not charge for the return shipping.  Low and behold, the refund was less the return shipping.  So another call to get the shipping refunded.  Now I have credit to purchase another in the correct size (or some other item) and look, another shipping charge for a replacement order.  This has gotten ridiculous.So in my experience this company tries to have good customer service, yet every time I call, I get someone that does not speak English as a first language, will not put me through to a supervisor, But I have been promised a return call within 3 days.  Mu next issue is the replies to complaints from this website, many of them use the phrase ""I am sorry for your inconvenience""  I do not know where that phrase started, but it has never been used by native English speakers.  However, I have read other replies that use correct use of an apology.

Email said the package would arrive on a Wednesday (4 days before the date of the birthday) - didn't arrive. Tracking on FedEx showed they never even received the package. Calling the Customer Service number just got a recording saying it was due to arrive on that Wednesday (even though this was now a day after that). Finally got through to someone, they said they'd send another. Was supposed to arrive By 8PM Friday (which was still the day before the birthday so ok) - but by Friday AM, FedEx showing they hadn't received the package, so no way would it get from Florida to Richmond VA in less than a day. Customer service said it should arrive by ""Sunday at the latest""  - I have zero confidence in this and am this point trying to find another company to order these birthday presents from. ALSO - YOU CANNOT UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THEIR MARKETING EMAILS. ""Click here to unsubscribe"" just takes you to their website. Clicking on ""unsubscribe from emails"" at the bottom of the page just gives you instructions to find ""email preferences"" at the top of the page and click on it - ""Email preferences"" does NOT exist at the top of the page - or anywhere on the website.

"Hate Fanatics.com","They suck.   After promising and making you pay for 4 day expedited delivery at gauging prices, have the nerve to say 4 days start with ship date, not order date.   Do not buy from these low lives",2020-10-21,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Brian","In the age of Ecommerce where the majority of retailers offer refunds free of charge, it's hard to believe Fanatics charges a return label fee. They deducted $9.99 to return a hat in a small box which is absurd. I will be taking my business elsewhere.",2020-10-20,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Fern","I honestly never write a review but this was the last straw for me and I just had to do it. It appears that Fanatics believes that as they grow bigger as a company that they can treat their customers like garbage, I guess this is how you act when you fell as if you have a monopoly on the market. The other reviews on this website DO NOT lie. I have been ordering from this company for many years and have put up with late deliveries, wrong products being sent, crazy shipping fees and exchange rates, but I have always been loyal. The customer service has never been great but was at least adequate in the past and they would eventually listen to your concern after a few attempts and some reasoning. However, if you are buying Internationally, DO NOT DO IT. I live in Canada and my most recent purchase of around $120 came out to roughly $210 dollars with the exchange rate and the over $55 dollars of shipping and tariffs. Even still, like a sucker I put up with this because if you want NFL and NCAA gear it is the price you pay when you live in Canada and the local stores do not carry as much stock in ways of these items. The reason for this terrible review though is regarding the purchase I made prior to this one which I just received yesterday, which was to be given as a Christmas gift, the shirt size normally ordered is XL or maybe XXL if it is a slim fitting item for this person. However, the item we received was an equivalent to a 4XL size if not even bigger and would not come close to fitting the recipient of the item, as it would almost fit like a dress. When contacting Fanatics Customer Service for over an hour and dealing with four separate representatives, two of which disconnected from the chat, all of them refusing to provide me with a fair solution. They wanted to refund me for the item and have me repurchase it with new shipping costs while also requiring me to cover the shipping costs of returning the item in question, furthermore, while also losing the money for the original shipping and tariff fees. So sorry for the long winded review, but long story short, please save your money and do not give it to this company. Buy local or support a mom and pop small business that will provide you with far superior better customer service. I will NEVER again purchase from this company after spending thousands over the years with them. The reviews on the internet do not lie everyone, they have four reviews that I know of rating them 3.7, 3.4, 1.6, 1.3, respectively and this many people cannot be wrong or it cannot be a coincidence, which I know from experience now to be true. STAY AWAY!  Do yourself a favor and save your money and your frustrations, you will be happy you did! The absolute Customer Service",2020-10-20,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"April Bustamante","So I placed an order for a personalized Dodger shirt for my dads birthday in November. It allows you to see what it looks like prior to purchasing. It was the pretty Dodger blue, the letters were big so I was like great. I placed the order and I received it within a decent time, I had waited a few days to open it but once I did, I was soo disappointed. It looks nothing like the picture. Granted I ordered a 3XL which measures 30"" in length. Out last name has 10 letters so you would think 3XL plenty of room... well, they only used 9"" to put our last name. The color blue is even off, it looks cheaply made and it even looks like it has some type of spots on the front that I just noticed when taking the pic. So the packing slip doesn't have a phone number, you go to the site and it tells you to chat with one of their reps after going through all that, they finally gave me a number to call, I talk to the rep and it was like a too bad so sad, after trying to get a sup with her which she refused when prior she kept on placing me on hold to talk to her sup, now no sup avail. I told her I would hold she refused and disconnected. Called back got a hold of someone didn't want to tell the story over and asked immediately for a sup finally after some back and forth with the rep and being on hold I was able to speak to a sup. Pretty much, it's personalized so I can't return it. They can't have another one made because they said it would look the same and then I asked for a full refund and the sup had to send to another dept and they would call me within 72 hours. The sup couldn't give me a direct # or even his employee # all I got was his name Joseph.

Yes, Richard's (it won't allow me to post, but you know the name of that store and it's not an offensive name, its the literal name of the company), Academy, Finish Line, Hibbet, etc. exist and you can always go other places, but the retail workers tend to be great. About three weeks ago, I ordered a jersey and some pops. For some reason, my shoprunner didn't go through and I got charged shipping. They figured that out and refunded me, no big deal. Today, I go to make another purchase (it's xmas shopping time already for me.) Order went through, great. I noticed a ""handling fee"" however. To be honest, that kind of irritated me because of that seeming like a way to sneak another charge onto someone. So, in my mood, I contact them via facebook and tell them to cancel the order. They did. After chilling out, I said ""it's still worth it"" in my head and so I go to reorder. I had $11+ in fan cash (keep in mind $3 per $100 and it expires every year, so that shows you how much I spend, but I wanted to use it on this transaction.) I knew they couldn't un-cancel an order, so I contact live chat. They told me to call them. I explained that I'm right beside the kid I'm getting the present for and if I order over the phone they'll hear....their response was ""go out for a walk or go to the bathroom"". It's a little kid.. I cannot just leave a kid by themselves. So, I explain that even further and the only other response I got was ""ok"". They truly don't care about you. Sports viewership is at an all time low and I'd imagine that's hurting sales like this. If they don't want to help, that's on them.

Finally, the order ships (on the 29th of Sept) and the provided tracking number is invalid (I opted for the trackable service).

"Alvin Eberhardt III","I think a lot of fanatics problems come from their custom orders and presale orders. I’ve placed 2 separate orders for masks. The first order came after a month and half with about two emails changing the estimated ship date. This second order (order 279-2990-8303) was ordered 7/14 and I’ve now received a 3rd email asking me to submit wether or not I’d like to continue waiting. It’s creeping up to 3 months at this point.

I on average I place an order 2-5 times a year, so I’m very confused on why it was sent to the old address. First off, there’s no CR phone number listed their site. You have to do live chat, which is pain with long wait times. When I explained what happened they said there was nothing they could do, like nothing.

"DW","This was a bad experience from the jump. My order came 2 weeks late to start off, which I contributed to the Covid situation.  No problem.  However, when I got my first order (3 shirts, skull cap, fitted cap), the product looked great however the sizes ran small. Ok, no big deal, I figured since I liked the look and just not the size, I would return it and get a different size.  And that's when the issue starts.  First I look to the website to find the return policy, pretty easy to find.  When I go to pick which item I want shipped back, I notice a huge price difference from what I paid to what the refund would be (and this is outside the $9.99 shipping label). So I call and get a rep who I'm telling about the item I'm returning.  I say the price was originally 34.99 but now I'm only being refunded 24.99, why is that? She says I see here it was $29.99 for the total after the discount.  i say, ok well if it's $29.99 after the discount, why is it showing me $24.99 now? From that point on the woman proceeds to tell me she never said $29.99, which I hope the call was recorded because she CLEARLY says it. Proceeds to talk while I'm talking, says she's using a calculator to prove her point, I  simply state I don't see the breakdown on the order in my account because the break down isn't applied per item, but one lump sum.  It's a rip off and a scam on returns on top of bad customer service.  I will never shop with them again and it's a shame MLB has partnered with them in order to sell products.",2020-09-09,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

"Oscar Castro","I've been buying jerseys from Fanatics.com for about 5 years or so. During this time I've purchased 12 jerseys, 17 hats, and 6 t shirts. I just recently purchased a new jersey for my daughter as one of her graduation presents. Since it was during a promo period I only paid $116.95 after tax and shipping for one of those Nike Vapor Limited. The new Nike jerseys run a size small so I had to return it. My understanding was that I would not get a refund on the shipping charges which is $9.99. So I was really surprised when I saw that Fanatics would only refund me $103.69. Correct me if I'm wrong but $116.95 minus $9.99 equals $106.96. I understand that is only a difference of $3.27 but at least get your s**t together and hire someone that can at least do some basic math. Not only that but the actual shipping and handling I was charged for my order was only $6.98! All I have left to say is FA-Q FANATICS.COM! I will do my shopping at a local store from now on.

After one hour on the phone, going through loops and transfers, and many ‘please hold while I talk to a supervisor’ requests I was told we were a couple of days past the 30 day period, and not only did they refuse to take it back for refund or credit, the ‘customer service’ rep was rude and argumentative. I was angry and wrote a review expressing that anger on Trustpilot.  Within a week I got a message from Fanatics.com.  They offered to take back the shirt for a refund, even without the tags.

Well I got a nice e big cart which I shouldvw had free shipping anyway cause I was spending about 300$ but I order i put in the code free ship and the code generates a free shipping icon well then I click next go to where you enter shipping info go through it all and they charged me 12$ or so shipping anyway that I didn't catch till after the order went through. Once I realized it somehow deleted my free shipping, I looked EVERYWHERE for a way to live chat or a email for customer service e and its no where!!! Called them and going through their automated voice recording was a bigger hoop than any I've ever called before. It does anything and everything to not let you talk to a customer service rep. Finally I get through and after explaining the situation this rude a$$ lady tells me I never entered the code. Like im a stupid and I didn't enter the code thats blasted everywhere on the website and I know i entered it but whatever she says she refunded the shipping still 25 days later still no refund. Well also same order I ordered face masks 4 pack, like I said its been 25 days, my order is still pending.

"John Mann","I cringe every time I want to buy Pro/College gear and the only place that has what I am looking for is a Fanatics site.  My latest purchase was from MLBShop, but it happens every time.  I think they blatantly lie about shipping times.  As it stands right now, it will take over a month to get 1 jersey that I assume they already had in stock (nothing custom about it).  There order tracking and shipment ""system"" is terrible.  It never updates and they clearly spend the least they can to ship.  All of my shipments must take the Pony Express to get from Kentucky to LA Area before they are put on the Mayflower to get to HI.  All of which is fine, but just let me know it's going to take 2 weeks longer than your told me when I purchased it.  Borderline fraudulent business practices as they know I'd look elsewhere if I knew from the get-go it would take over a month.  Also, I can never find my order on my account, by clicking the link in the email, or entering the order info into their webpage.  I have us the automated chat helper???  Why do I have to do this every time I want to track an order from Fanatics?  It doesn't show up in my recent orders and when I input the same data I did here in the form on the ""Track Order"" page, it cannot find it?  The link to the order in the email receipt doesn't work either.  I don't know why it is so hard for Fanatics to figure out this process.  Literally the last Ecommerce site that still can't figure out how to ship and track properly.  If I had other options, I'd use them, but they seem to be getting a monopoly on authentic sports gear.  I have not received my item yet so I can't speak to the quality.  According to Fanatics site, it should arrive to day, but FEDEX has it arriving 4 September.

"Fawn Monroe","If I could I would give zero stars. I honestly have never had so much trouble ordering a shirt online even in the middle of a pandemic, so I of course expect delays but Fanatics is disorganized and the ordering process has been horrible! I ordered a special shirt on Fanatics that I was super excited about in the beginning of July. They kept dragging out and changing the shipping date randomly pushing the shipping date farther and farther back. I’m supposed to get emails about the delays but I don’t think I received them and not in my spam. I didn’t know until I tried to check tracking myself. I’m still waiting for my shirt. I talked to a couple of customer service agents and they couldn’t really help me which I have never had happen. Usually, customer service agents work hard to help you resolve your issues with orders. Both of them didn’t seem to genuinely care about customer service satisfaction and none were able to give me a clear answer.  The original customer service agent I spoked to said my order had indeed shipped and that I should receive it by August 10th. I go to check my tracking and now it says hasn’t shipped yet and won’t be until mid or later on August. The shipment date has changed 2-3 times now. The second customer service agent couldn’t really help me either except to say sorry for the delay.  It’s been over a month and still hoping to receive my order. I wouldn’t recommend buying from Fanatics. Seriously never had this much confusion and problems ordering online before. Sometimes, there will be delays but not a continuous changing of shipment dates that push farther and farther back without updated communication like I have experienced with Fanatics.",2020-08-01,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

Somewhere that has more than just a few items as I would rather purchase from one place rather than a few items from a bunch of different places.  I got excited when I found fanatics because I finally found somewhere with many *new to my eyes* options, a bunch of items I know he would love. I was rounding up items to throw in my cart but figured I should probably check the reviews quickly before placing the order. All the negative reviews are worrisome now though and I have decided to hold off on placing my order in hopes to maybe read some feedback first. Please!! ... I am in Canada, if that matters?  I am always reluctant to make online purchases from somewhere that is new to me, however, given the current situation I don't have much of a choice as all the other places I would normally order from either have nothing that I haven't scrolled past already, or as I mentioned earlier- only have one or two random items. Has anyone else in Canada made any recent purchases? How long did you have to wait for delivery? Did you receive all of your items at once, or were they delivered sporadically? I hope this is okay to post, and I really hope that I can place my order! If so, I will definitely post a proper review. TIA",2020-08-09,3,"Trust Pilot",NA

Even more ridiculous was that three days after the indicated delivery date, they send me an email saying that the ordered printing (Cavani - 9; PSG) is out of stock. What the hell?! As jerseys can be personalized, they should still have the number 9 as well as these five letters...Now, again two weeks later I still did neither receive my jersey nor an adequate response stating when my order will be delivered.

This despite it says EVERYWHERE, that they have a 365-day return policy.  When I attempted to reach out to a person via their chat function, I was just sent to the same web page for returns.

When I got it on, myself along with my girlfriend could only do one thing, laugh, laugh, dry the laughing tears from all over our faces, take it off  laid it on the bed and tryed to figure out how it could have been stamp, stitched the size 4X when without a doubt it was at best a medium. Now I look at the procedure to return it..only to find out other than ""manufacturers defact "" its going to cost me 9.95!?!? ... Wait, what, pay the shipping cost to send back an item that was clearly a medium size at best... Was told several different ways what warrants a return and I would have to buy the 9.95 shipping cost because it was a manufacturing issue or Error. Now please tell me how in the hell something that I ordered in the 4X size, it stated on the bag and the manufacturers tag it was a size 4X but was a medium size at best not a manufacturing defact!!???   I certainly didn't wave a magic stick, say abra gadaba cozoo and boom magically turn it into a medium size... No.. correct, I didn't. So that tells me, along with two other people in the room that it was manufactured a size medium but clearly tagged, sold,shipped as a 4X!!  That is a manufacturer, and clearly your company's fault, 100%, and you tell me it doesn't meet a free shipping back to you, and ship a correct size 4.

(This is after their automated computer continuously kept telling me its on its way) The representative then informed me the package was lost on its way here over a week ago. No one had offered to let me know this or give me any sort of discount until I took it upon myself to follow it. Absolute crooks and they would of tried to keep my money if I didnt say anything about it.

Also, is it a requirement for recruitment that you have to have at most a D in English Language GCSE?

Chuck: Hi Tia, I purchased this shirt in April, Ive worn and washed it no more than 4 or 5 times and the imprint ink is coming off in flakes. The imprint quality is terrible. I started to process a return and see that you want to charge me $10. This is unacceptable for an issue related to quality. Tia: I can't guarantee a return will be processed for this order ,but I will be more than happy to assist you with that. May you please provide me with your order number please? Chuck: 365-1357-7XXX Tia: Thank you so much for that information. Please allow me a few moments to review your order. Chuck: thank you Tia: No problem. Tia: Please allow me just a few more moments. Chuck: sure Tia: Thank you for holding. Tia: I did speak with my supervisor she advise no return would be excepted for this item due to it not being in the original condition. She advise that she will refund 15% of the merchandise total. The refund will go back to the original method used at check out Chuck: So, you are telling me that your company does not stand behind the quality of the products you sell??? Tia: We do. If that happen on the first was or it was like that when you first open the package we could have tried to work with the warehouse on excepting the return. Tia: But do to it being washed multiple times and no tags available they aren't going to except the return, Chuck: I happen to be in the imprinted apparel industry, I know when a product has not been screen printed and cured properly which is exactly the case here. Chuck: Now I understand the overwhelming amount of negative reviews posted all over the internet about this company. As an NFL season ticket holder, I am amazed that the NFL has granted a license to such an incompetent organization. I will forward my complaint directly to both the NFL and the NE Patriots organization. Tia: We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. The 15% off refund has been issued. The refund will go back on the original form of payment in 2-7 business days. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Chuck: Tia, I know that this decision is not yours and it must be frustrating to sit and listen to complaints all day, day after day. Good luck to you! Tia: Thank you.

I'm in Australia and knew in these unprecedented times they could take a while to get here, but was given a date of May 11 for delivery. Fast forward to the 27th May and I start getting a bit concerned. Speak to someone on the chat and they tell me my package hasn't moved since the 14th and offers to send it again, but without 2 of the items I'd already paid for. So where is the original package? Over $500 spent and this is the service they dish up? Utterly pathetic.

I'll tell you what kind — Bad companies. There are plenty of sites to buy Sports Merch. that allow for free returns. Find those places. I made a mistake even looking there. Don't buy from Fanatics unless you are 1000% sure what your buying fits. Lesson Learned.

"Shawn","Horrible company. I agree with the others I would leave zero star if i could. Amazing they are the preferred partner or claim to be the partner of the major sports leagues. If true; it just shows you these leagues only care about money and not their fans. I haven't seen a rating above 2 out of 5 on any of the sites. Why would the major sports choose to partner which such a poor company.....GREED! Had multiple bad experiences, damaged goods, canceled orders etc. Most recent was a Colby White Autograph card at a great price that was a birthday present.  As the card market boomed mysteriously a few days later the ordered was canceled and the card was unavailable. I'm just waiting for it to reappear back on the site now at 3  times the price. At a minimum they have poor inventory management and oversold the product and at max they purposefully canceled to resale at a higher price. Either way horrible service and a ruined Birthday.Update: It just gets worse. Received an email from Jason K at Fanatics asking about my experience. After taking the time to write a lengthy reply to Jason detailing my issue, he replied and ask for my phone contact. After I provided, he called (he did apologize) and then took more of my time to rehash the issue, then informed me because it was an internet order I needed to call another department!! He knew is was in internet order before he contacted me!!! Just like all the fanatics replies on this site to the other complaints. They just say they are sorry and move on. Hence the extensive bad reviews. Also, Jason never did inform me what happened to my item. He also did not respond to my statement that as card prices are booming sellers are canceling paid orders for high demand items to sell them at a higher price.",2020-05-19,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

Fanatics was out of stock so I ordered a size higher (XL) thinking she could wear it camping or around the house. Received the XL sweatshirt which did not fit. Trying to return it and noticed outrageous fees. Wish I would have looked up the reviews first. I honestly believe Fanatics uses inflated shipping and return fees as apart of their business model. I cannot believe that in 2020 a company chooses to conduct business with a $9.99 return label fee. I might enjoy the sweatshirt more by burning it so I have peace of mind knowing Fanatics cannot resell it and scam another customer.",2020-05-19,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

I spent a lot of time talking with customer service, who gave me lame excuses by trying to educate me on the banking industry.  I explained that my original method of payment had been closed, and that you cannot credit a closed account.  I even had the issuing bank confirm this.  When speaking with a manager over the phone, she mentioned giving a merch credit, but never followed through.  Order at your risk of no refund. Low-rated Ebay sellers are more trustworthy.2020:Funny how when in April 2019, I contacted the company and spoke with the same agent ""Chastity"" who is responding to my review, giving me the same crap story below as when I spoke with them a year ago.Chastity S. wrote: -------------------------Thank you for reaching out.

No account, no money credited to it. So a year later, your company refuses to do anything about this, while you have resold the same merchandise to someone else.

This happened 3 more times after being on the phone with customer service and them assuring me this order would be sent to my son in the military.  This  was a gift for him and he really wanted this hat.  The multiple excuses were ridiculous as to why the order wasn’t shipped!  Consuelo the supervisor in customer service is very rude!  I will NEVER order from them again!  This was my first and last time doing business with this company!  I could’ve went to a sporting good store and bought the hat and shipped it myself and he would’ve gotten it months ago!  I placed this order 4 times and still don’t have the merchandise!

"Meeme","Terrible. If I could give ZERO STARS, I would. Ordered two shirts,both were mailed separately. First one that arrived was totally the wrong shirt. Not even close. *Also they do NOT include a packing slip listing the item you ordered or a return label Incase you want to return the item. When I called customer service, I waited 10 minutes before a rep connected and remained silent on the other line. I could actually hear them breathing. Finally I said “I can hear you I’m not hanging up” that’s when I was disconnected. A few days later I called again and was told in the event I do not have access to a printer I should ask a neighbor and then call fedex or ups to pick up the package to be returned. WHAT? When I explained that seemed a little ridiculous considering shelter in place orders- I was repeatedly told that’s just the policy. Give me a break. AND the rep disconnected me because I kept inquiring how they would fix this issue. I think they leave out the return label etc because it discourages people from making returns and points out the obvious error in picking and shipping the item. Overall this company is crappy and lacking on all levels. From sending the correct order, including return labels and policies , and customer service- they really are not trying to pay their employees to do their jobs so whatever shows up at your door isn’t their problem. **Fanatics- have a talk with your customer service.

Seeing their ""365-Day Easy Returns"" policy, I called Fanatics Customer Service to exchange it expecting a straightforward process but was told that their site had a ZERO return policy and the sale was final because they claim it was ordered from the ""outlet"" version of their website. I clearly have confirmation emails stating my order was from FANATICS.COM and nowhere does it say in any of my 5 emails that it came from FANATICSOUTLET.COM as they claim. I explained to the manager that I simply went to the website FANATICS.COM and ordered the sweatshirt. I have no idea what they see on the backend and that is frankly not my problem.  The manager REFUSED to give me a refund and would not even provide me with the option of an exchange or store credit (not that I will ever buy anything from them again).  Her answer was just, ""we can't help you."" Nothing else. She would not honor the return policy despite me having proof in 5 emails that my purchase was from FANATICS.COM. So this ""365-Day Easy Returns"" policy is clearly a LIE. I never write reviews but this encounter was exceptionally frustrating. People should know how dishonest this company is.

When I called this morning, we were informed that the other 2 items came from a different warehouse and that they would be shipped overnight, but only when they left the warehouse.

Delivery usually took 7/10 days and I was constantly kept informed. UK site likewise has been good.Only complaint I have is that prices in the UK site have more then doubled for a large amount of items, especially NIKE.

"Jason Lassiter","Hello, I am writing this response not to blast the Fanatics corporation, but to excoriate the United States government for allowing companies like Fanatics, Amazon, and many of our countries banking establishments to continue to blatantly rob American consumers of their right to choose. Many US Banks and corporations are continuing to merge at alarming rates, as well as in be exempt from any resistance from the United States government. Fanatics has almost cornered the market when it comes to sports merchandising. They are stripping away the American consumer’s privilege to choose. Fanatics signed a deal to be the #1 distributor of merchandise for the four major sports leagues. The United States government is continuing to do very little to curtail this flagrant abuse of monopolizing strategies used by these aforementioned companies. Fanatics is not a very scrupulous business. They nonchalantly package customer BOUGHT items loosely and unwrapped in boxes. Thus, allowing items to get tossed around and damaged while being shipped. Furthermore, an item that is purchased on a Thursday and paid to be shipped with 2 day delivery usually doesn’t get shipped out until Monday even if 2 day shipping was purchased. Personally, I placed an order for an item on a Thursday. I also paid extra for the 2 day shipping  method; however, when I checked on the status of the order, the fanatics website stated that order was still being processed, and it had not even gone out to be shipped yet. Why not? Can someone please explain to me, in layman’s terms, why my orders hasn’t even shipped yet even though the order was placed on a Thursday. Thank You 😊",2020-03-15,2,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Rocco","I am a passionate sports fan who loves supporting my teams. I typically purchase at least 1 hat per team per season and usually buy multiple based on the designs For that season. I have new era, ‘47 brand, Nike, ua Reebok, and Adidas just to name a few. I have had a great experience with these companies. Each company has its quirks but overall they are quality products and I continue to purchase hats from these companies.  I recently purchased my first fanatics brand hat and could not be more disappointed. I purchased the hat because the hat selection for NHL teams is limited and I wanted to try something new. The fit is terrible and does not stay in place, I am constantly adjusting the hat. The material does not breathe and is hot making it problematic to wear outdoors. The overall material quality is that of the cheap plastic giveaway hats handed out at games. I would not recommend this product to anyone and would not purchase again. These hats are priced the same as new era and other brands, while the product fanatics delivers leaves everything to be desired. These hats should be priced about half  of what they are. I was looking to purchase jerseys and other products from fanatics but will not at this point. If they can’t get hats right how could any of their other products be any different.",2020-03-15,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

Let me not forget to mention what I got versus the picture WAS WAY WAY OFF! Not even close to what was promised. They are thieves.As for why I will make sure to curse their name to anyone I know I have a quick read. I wanted a Derrick Henry Jersey and found a good coupon code to save $25(with their shady taxing and slightly overpriced shipping that net savings was still less than 13 bucks) I ordered 1 size too large by mistake. I contacted them within the first hour post order and asked them to change the size for me, simple right? Nope I'm told they can't do that. I said no problem just cancel my order for me so I can order the right size right now please. Of course they can't do that either. Why did they do that to a customer? Because by having to return it their horrid anti customer policies is gonna reduce my refund by 15 bucks! Then they tell me I can just order it no problem(laughable!) so they can not accept that same coupon and I can get screwed out of another 5 bucks minimum, 20 bucks or so maximum on top of that 15. That process they want me to go through would see me throw away 35 dollars for LITERALLY NO REASON other than their greed. Dont forget they charge like 8 bucks in taxes even though they aren't in my state! So take that 35 they want me to throw away and turn it into 43 dollars. 43 freakin' bucks when you account for all the garbage charges and them being thieves! Why would anyone support a company that does THIS to a customer who only wanted to get 1 size smaller!?!? Avoid them as if they are a cancer to common decency.Of course I could've avoided a lot of that hit if I simply exhanged the jersey right? THEY DON'T OFFER EXCHANGES so they can railroad you via the process above I mentioned.Do NOT believe any customer service bs you see here from Fanatics, I tried tirelessly to fix the most simple issue and they completely refused to even attempt to help me every step of the way. Any ""care"" they have for their customers is nothing but a front. I could not be an easier to please customer I would've even said screw it and let them burn me on 10 dollars FOR A RETURN LABEL just to get the right size sent back to me BUT NO I can't even ask for that. $10 for a sticker but nah they wanted to screw me out of as much as possible. I hope their company crumbles.Update:Only after this review I finally did get some results with their link. I'll give them credit they took off the 10 charge for the return label and gave me a slightly better 1 time use coupon code. I didnt lose as much and I was able to get the right size jersey in the end. I still ended up losing a bit, but in the end the solution was much more reasonable.With that said considering how hard I had to work to finally get a solution I still would rate them 1 star. It was a painfully annoying process, and it should've been as simple as possible.",2020-03-04,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

Don't give me the ""We're sorry about your experience and we'll try to fix it"" crap. I paid $60 for a hoodie that is probably really worth a fraction of that. The material itself is something I could buy at Walmart for $9.99. Slap a few mini logos on there and charge an astronomical amount for it. If it resembled the pic I wouldn't be so PO'd.

"Ingrid Shanklin","I agree with others who have reviewed this site. It is by far the worst return policy/customer service I have ever encountered. I bought a customized hoodie for my husband's birthday (which was yesterday)well in advance but didn't open it since it was a gift. I see it this morning, eyes wide open, mouth agape...there is NO personalization. I called customer service with my complaint (in addition to speaking with an agent, I spoke with a manager- I don't recall her name unfortunately) I asked if I could send the hoodie back to have it personalized since it was fanatics' fault it wasn't done as I ordered, the answer was no. ""We cannot do that, the item would be considered defective and donated someplace."" WTW???Any other company I've dealt with in past has allowed me to keep the item (especially if the mistake was on their end) and offer a full refund-for the inconvenience and good measure. No such thing here, ""you will have to return the item, get a partial refund, and we will send you a new hoodie personalized in an XXL."" I'm undone at this point.. ""So, let me get this right..I must return the item, receive a partial refund, then, pay for another customized hoodie larger than the one originally ordered?!?!?"" Seriously?? Oh yeah, the silver lining/""you better be glad you're getting this much because I'm doing you a solid"" insult to injury, a coupon for 30% off on a future order. I have shopped all over the world and this rates as one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Fanatics needs to take a few pages from an Amazon or Nordstrom's customer service manual Chapter One: ""How to treat customers you want to see as return customers and tell their friends so they will order too.""  I was offered a return label which I will use post haste, but refused the coupon, telling the manager I wouldn't need it because I will never place another order with this company again. I did not ask for special treatment, I did not want something for nothing. I simply wanted to be treated as a valued customer; one they wanted to see satisfied after they made the error. The full amount I paid was taken, but I didn't receive what I paid for. I am disappointed because this was to be the perfect birthday present for my husband; he is a die hard Dallas Cowboys fan. I know now Fanatics is not the place to have expectations met or satisfaction guaranteed as stated. I would highly recommend anyone perusing this site to take a very close look at reviews, especially negative ones before placing an order. To their credit, the other item purchased was the right thing; however, the experience I had wiped away any consolation that may have been. My first order has become my last. I will voice my displeasure on Facebook as well.",2020-02-19,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

I have paid an exorbitant amount of AUD to return the items, and was issued a link to a gift certificate that is invalid and non-functional due to my being in Australia. Seems ridiculous that I can purchase, receive items, and return, all successfully from here, but getting an electronic gift certificate to work is a physical impossibility??? Add to that, the feat of contacting anyone who has any helpful info is like finding a Unicorn. I am at an absolute loss as to why the parts of this transaction that could have been a struggle due to being in two different countries went well, yet in the Digital age we live in, the ability to process a E Gift Certificate is not something that is achievable.... Money transferred out of my account flawlessly, goods were returned and received at the suppliers end smoothly, albeit at my large cost, but here we are, at a logjam due to the fact that my being in Australia is now a problem for transactions....Seems suspect to me....

Shipping from FL to PA shouldn’t take 10 days...last time I’ll use this service and will be certain to make it known for others not to order items from this pathetic service.Update...very nice of the company to reply. However, it’s clearly a ploy to save face. This item was not “made to order”, this item was a standard team logo t-shirt. So, this company not only can’t execute a timely order, after being called out on it, they lie to save face. I’m glad TrustPilot emailed me to let me know to check on the reply.

"Chance Anderson","I bought a Travis Kelce Chiefs sweatshirt near the beginning of December, bitter end of November. It comes 2-3 days after the date I was told it would. It has a decent amount of threads hanging off of it varying lengths. I cut them off and go on as the rest of the product looks like a decent quality.  I wash the sweatshirt once and it loses a minor amount of the lettering, which surprised me because it still was a large amount lost in a first wash. I wear it a few more times, but the most recent time I noticed the lettering was a good 75% missing. I have ordered many sweatshirts, and I have a decent amount with the same type of lettering material used which have lasted much longer than this one. I called customer support today. The first time I called, a customer support member answered then immediately hung up. It was a 23 minute wait prior to their answering. I called again, 45 minute wait this time, I finally get an answer and they find my order. The support member offers me a 20% off code, which the NFL Shop always has and it doesn't stack, as he says it cannot be returned or exchanged. I am disappointed in the lack of quality of the goods I received as well as the support I was given. Will most likely not purchase from again unless this situation is resolved",2020-01-30,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

Today, Fanatics sends me an email and advises that due to Kobe's death, they are cancelling my order and refunding my money.  They will most likely sell what I bought for much more money.  That will help my small claims court lawsuit.  I am contacting the consumer affairs department with the state Attorney General's office regarding Fanactics fraudulent activity.  Do not buy anything from this phony company.Today, they contacted me and said that when they sold me the item, they were all sold out.  This is inconsistent with what they originally told me.

I sent the first one back and the second shirt did the same thing. On top of that I had store credit and fan cash that was to expire on 12/31. I tried to use it but only the fan cash was in my account. Contacted customer service two days before the expiration date (on the phone for almost an hour!) to find out why the store credit wasn’t in my account and I was told it was a ‘coding’ issue. They gave mean issue number and told me I would receive a phone call or email in “a couple of days” with an update on my account. Needless to say I never received any communication and the fan cash and store credit have not been restored to my account.  No wonder they don’t have any way to provide feedback on their site - either for their products or service.  I had over $14 available to use but will NOT be doing business with them anymore. I don’t have the time to spend waiting to talk with someone to then buy cheap products.Follow up response to email from Fanatics. I appreciate the timely response. But 10% off doesn’t really even cover the shipping cost. Most of the time you can find a code for free shipping on their website but you can only use one coupon at a time.  To clarify, the store credit was offered because of a returned item that was defective and all the emails I received up until December 31 indicated I had a $14 credit. I wanted to use the combined credit with free shipping so the total value was ~$20. The 10% does not come close to addressing the issue.

Printed a return label from the site and then called to make sure I’d get a gift card instead of the credit going back to gift giver. I was told not to use the label I’d printed but to use the one they would send to my email so it could be processed as a gift return. Five days later...no label. Called again and was told that since I had already printed a label, they couldn’t print a second one and the only option was to credit the original form of payment...less the return shipping fee which would have been waived if processed as a gift.

The new item still doesn't fit, and it is out of stock. My only option is to hang onto something I paid for but will never wear, or lose $11 of the $33 I spent on shipping (which I would be sticking to the person trying to give me a Christmas gift who already paid for shipping the first time around and lost it in the first refund.)I certainly will remember next time not to order from here.

She remained in constant contact while a replacement product was processed and then helped to close the issue with a new replacement product delivered. Here is where I feel like Cristin’s customer service truly stood out. All of this happened during the height of Christmas orders/deliveries and I have no doubt it was a crazy period of time for her.

"Debbie","I received a pull-over jacket for Christmas and the first time I wore it the hem came out.  I called to return for another jacket and they are sold out and only wanted to send me a prepaid label to return and get a refund.  The problem is that I really like the jacket and am willing to have it repaired and asked for a 50% reduction in price to compensate for the cost of repair.  They will only give 20% which is 1/2 of the cost to have repaired.  I am furious with them as they were willing to pay for me to return item and give full refund but not help me pay to repair item.  I will never order anything from them again.  I should have read the reviews first before ordering as they have over 85% bad reviews!!!!",2020-01-03,1,"Trust Pilot",NA
"Nancy Wojtowicz","I ordered a hat for a Christmas present. When it arrived it was too large. All I wanted to do was exchange it for a smaller size. What a time consuming and expensive process. I had to pay $9 just to ship the hat back and then I had to repurchase the same hat ( and the price had been raised by $10 ) so a hat that originally cost around $30 is now up to $60-$70!! I only received a $16 refund . If I hadn’t needed this for Christmas there is no way I would ever order from this company. My advice, stay as far away as possible or you will waste a lot of money and time. They do not care about their customers.",2020-01-03,1,"Trust Pilot",NA

I thought their prices were good for licensed apparel.Before placing my order, I checked their returns page (returns.fanatics.com) to see if it would cost anything for a return.  Didn't see anything about fees, just that their returns are ""simple and hassle free"".My order total was $50+, but one of the shirts I ordered ($15 after 25% off) was too big, even though the same size hoodie fit my Dad fine.Paying $10 to return a $15 shirt just doesn't make sense.

When I asked if I could just get another item of similar value they told me it was not their policy to do that. I don't feel the item mattered as much as my experience of which the result was a broken guarantee to deliver a gift before Christmas. And then just never sending the gift at all.

I have never ever encountered such an approach and attitude about customer service. This was an open and close flat out error on faulty product and every such situation I have ever encountered the retail companies just do the right thing and send out a new replacement or alternative (ie different color in this case).

"Jack Tripper","I purchased two hoodies from this place recently.  Any time you purchase something online without seeing it first, you're taking a chance. My skepticism was already quite high, having never purchased a 'Fanatics' brand hoodie before. I knew nothing about the quality, but figured I'd take a chance. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!   I typically purchase my hoodies a size up, allowing for layering, and overall comfort. I ordered both hoodies in size 2XL, feeling pretty confident they'd fit with plenty of room to spare. WRONG!!!  After removing the hoodies from their packaging, I could immediately tell they were cut small. The graphics were small, and looked cheap. The 2XL hoodies are nowhere near true 2x sizing. At the MOST, they're cut no bigger than a size Large, if that.  I can only imagine what would happen after they're washed. The quality is HORRIBLE! The hoodies are extremely cheaply made, with very thin material, and you can't stretch them at all either. I thought maybe with a bit of stretching, I'd be good to go. NOPE!   Next time you're considering one of their brand hoodies, take a good long look at the sizes available. You'll notice that the real big sizes are all sold out.

Until Dec 8,2020 I got an email from them which said my order can't be fulfilled because is out of stock. Don't know why it took them 3 weeks just to notify me.

By using that e-mail, I got immediate and thorough response! Not sure how that other person got that e-mail address, but I could not find it anywhere, which is still unacceptable (the valid e-mail was different than the bogus e-mail on my packing slip). So, I was given a postage paid mailing label to return the rug. I was sent a replacement rug quickly. The replacement rug was exactly the same as the first! I am just going to keep it. Most importantly, I got a credit to my PayPal account for the cost of the rug and was not charged for the second one.",NA,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

The second order was a bundle of 2 shirts, one shirt the entire logo is off center (very obvious that it's not suppose to be like that) the logo almost goes into the armpit.

When I took it out of the bag the ""k"" of New York was already peeling off. Was disappointed but ultimately decided to use fabric glue and attach it back on myself. I had gotten it on sale for about $50–you get what you pay for. About a year and a half later I saw NFL jerseys on sale so I figured I'd give it a shot again, hoping my experience before was some kind of flukey mistake. It was not. I bought a ""Nike Game Player Jersey"" and I could tell immediately upon seeing the product in person that the screen printed numbers and logos were of very poor quality. But I was willing to keep it because, as I said before, you get what you pay for. Although, this time I paid $80, so I was a little more bitter about it. Anyway, I brought the jersey to my closet to hang it up and immediately the screen printed number on the shoulder began to crack. Just awful. Had no choice but to return it. And the final kicker—I didn't even receive a full refund. They charge a $10 fee to send it back to them. So for jerseys, you'll find better quality on a $20 knockoff than you'll find on this site—don't waste your time or money.",2020-09-04,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

The worst experience came when the customer service agent continued telling me ""don't worry"" when I explained my frustration with the process. He assured me a supervisor would be reaching out in a few minutes. Which never happened.
I decided to call back and finally got a helpful agent on the phone. Ariel took the time to find any solution to make sure that my issue was resolved. She created a ticket for the memorabilia team to respond, something no one else did for me.
Lilly from the memorabilia team reached out and although my item had been more than 30 days since receipt, she made sure I was taken care of because she saw that I had been making attempts to fix the issue for over a month.

While I would say a majority of the customer service people here have never been very helpful, Ariel and Lilly were incredible and very helpful.

"Elizabeth M.","I ordred a Jersey as a Christmas present and was sent a defective item with a pull on the front of it. I was understanding that things happen but asked to exchange it for a new one, I needed it quickly because it is a Christmas gift. I told them I would rather keep the one I had and return it after Christmas than risk my child not getting the gift they were asking Santa for. In speaking with a supervisor he assured that I should use the provided return label and that right when the post office scanned it in I would be issued my refund in the original form if payment which was a gift card. Well, that was a lie. I now shipped the item back to Fanatics 12 days ago and still have not received my refund. I can't order another Jersey because I want to use the refunded gift card to pay for the new order, not cash. I placed my order for this Jersey for my son's Santa gift on November 27th. It is now December 16th and I still do not have his gift. We are now 4 business days from Christmas and I haven't even received my refund, let alone placed the new order. This was an error on the part of Fanatics to send me a damaged Jersey and they have made it 100% my problem that they made this mistake and left me high and dry on my son's Christmas.

These guys don't ship for free and include incredibly high charges just to ship product. These guys offer no customer support and always include incredibly long shipping times.

Then when I try to talk to customer service on there stupid virtual chat, I got the run around until eventually I was disconnected cause of lack of knowledge about said job responsibilities or just trained to be a P.

"Paul F.","On December 8, I ordered the jersey from my daughter's favorite baseball team as one of her main Christmas presents. I live in a rural area and there is no home delivery of mail; everything goes to a PO Box, although the street address is used by UPS for its deliveries. I used the PO Box address when ordering the jersey. NOTHING in the website said that PO Box addresses couldn't be used. On December 23 I got an email from fanatics.com: (1) saying that the shipper (OnTrac) couldn't deliver my package because they didn't deliver to post office boxes; and (2) asking for my street address. I sent back my street address literally the moment I finished reading their email, which was less than two hours after they sent the email. On December 26, I hadn't heard anything back from them or from the shepherd. I called the shipper. They told me that fanatics.com had transposed the first two digits of my street address (thus creating a non-existent address), that the package was undeliverable and had already been returned by the shipper to fanatics.com. I called fanatics.com. I told the customer service rep (from another country) that what I wanted them to do was send me, by next day delivery, the jersey that I had ordered 2 ½ weeks before Christmas, an order that the company made at least three independent mistakes on. After being placed on hold for almost 15 minutes, I was told that the only thing the company could or would do was give me a refund, which would be processed hopefully 7 to 10 business days after the shirt was received by them. My daughter is a hard-core fan of our local team, but if fanatics.com was the only source of baseball-related items, I would tell her to forget about baseball and become a curling fan.

Why would anyone pay $9.99 to return a pair of $15 socks. This was more than they charged to ship me my entire order. Their online chat isn't really a chat. It gives canned responses. I spoke to a customer service rep and was told they would refund me ""this one time"". Instead of crediting me they sent me another label! Clearly I already returned the item hence the charge. Needless to say, after making multiple purchases from this company this was my last. I will never buy anything from them again. Also beware of their free shipping.

I think they blatantly lie about shipping times. As it stands right now, it will take over a month to get 1 jersey that I assume they already had in stock (nothing custom about it).
There order tracking and shipment ""system"" is terrible. It never updates and they clearly spend the least they can to ship. All of my shipments must take the Pony Express to get from Kentucky to LA Area before they are put on the Mayflower to get to HI. All of which is fine, but just let me know it's going to take 2 weeks longer than your told me when I purchased it. Borderline fraudulent business practices as they know I'd look elsewhere if I knew from the get-go it would take over a month. Also, I can never find my order on my account, by clicking the link in the email, or entering the order info into their webpage. I have us the automated chat helper? Why do I have to do this every time I want to track an order from Fanatics? It doesn't show up in my recent orders and when I input the same data I did here in the form on the ""Track Order"" page, it cannot find it? The link to the order in the email receipt doesn't work either. I don't know why it is so hard for Fanatics to figure out this process. Literally the last Ecommerce site that still can't figure out how to ship and track properly. If I had other options, I'd use them, but they seem to be getting a monopoly on authentic sports gear. I have not received my item yet so I can't speak to the quality. According to Fanatics site, it should arrive to day, but FEDEX has it arriving 4 September.

When I go to return it, they are charging me $10 to ship the hat back to them - meaning, now, I would only get 50% of the price I paid originally. The hat was priced at $32, they charged me $5 for shipping and $2 for handling with taxes the hat came to $40 and now after receiving the hat after almost 2 weeks - they use the cheapest method to ship btw - they want to give me only $22 back.

I ordered a shirt with an Oklahoma State logo on it, and the shirt (which ironically was the correct shirt) did not fit me. I paid shipping costs to return it, and then received another shirt that fit, but the stitching on the logo was totally incorrect. The colors were completely inverted, so it looks like some odd alternate logo. I contacted customer service and they assured me I would receive the correct shirt. However, I called them again when this shirt did not arrive on time, and they told me it had been returned to sender (you would think you would inform your customer of this, but they failed to do so, as it had been returned several days prior to my phone call). The address was the exact same as the first and second delivery, so it was an issue on Fanatics's end. Then, when I tried to have it shipped again to a different address (I had moved addresses at this point because it had been such a long process), they entered my address incorrectly. I had to call again and change my address. After all this, a customer service rep assured me that the producer of the product had verified I would be receiving the correct product as advertised. To my surprise, I once again received a shirt with a faulty logo. In addition, at some point in the process, I also had a customer service rep ask for my phone number to begin a call ""in case we became disconnected"", which we did, and I never received a call back. Since my second faulty product was received, I have tried contacting a customer service rep via an email thread that we had going at one point, and all communication has halted from their end.

I never dry my workout shirts so they'll last long, because they are fairly expensive. Customer support was only willing to refund/discount 30% since it had been worn, meaning they aren't standing behind their products and the quality has slipped tremendously as they've gotten bigger and bigger and moved into autographs and trading cards. Problem is... they seem to have a monopoly in selling sports team items, they all say ""A Fanatics experience"" if it's NFL shop, NHL shop or whatever sport.

Soo disappointing. I will never shop here again. I thought since it was supposedly ""official"" I would get much better service. First jersey; too big.

I paid with a gift card I regretfully received at Christmas. After sending the item back and finding out that they didn't have my shirt in size L, I just wanted a refund placed back on the gift card. I received an email that sit the refund would be issued to my original payment method. After picking out a different item to order, I tried my gift card and it said it had a zero balance. I contacted fanatics through their chat, and after the chat timing out 4 times, I was issued a refund for $3.02. The original refund says it should've been $21.99. I don't understand why it's so difficult to order a Tshirt. I just gave up, fanatics can keep my $21.99 as well as the $3.02 refund to my gift card. I started this tshirt order over 3 months ago and still dont have a shirt or the amount that I should have on my gift card.

Most recent was a preorder of football trading cards. They were shipped without packing materials and damaged upon arrival. Should be a simple fix…. But not with Fanatics. Tried to process a return thru their website but it wouldn't allow me. The site stated I needed to call in for this item. I filed a dispute with PayPal and uploaded photos of the damage. 48 hours later, they didn't even answer the dispute. I reluctantly called the main line. After providing all the information I was given another number and informed I needed to call Fan Services. This fist call was 7 minutes. I then called Fan Services and had to provide all the same information again. After going through everything again, I was told this had to be forwarded to another department and it would be 2-3 business days and additional instructions would come by email. This second call took an addition 15 minutes. I have over $400 of worthless product. This isn't a return because I changed my mind, they sent me damaged product.

"jeremy t.","Fanatics is a joke and scam. I ordered my items on 22 Jul and it's website stated that my order will be delivered by 5 Aug. By 5 Aug, my order clearly didn't arrive and based on tracking information, it showed that the package was still stuck at the USA warehouse. I made a complain on 11 Aug and they said apparently my order had gotten lost on transit. Thereafter, they said they would re-ship my items but because one of my items had ran out of stock, I had to place a new order.

Both items were now re-shipped on 16 Aug and based on their website, it stated the package would arrive by 30 Aug. AGAIN, as of 30 Aug- my packages are still stuck in the US warehouse. When I checked with their live agent through the chats, they apologised and said my items have unfortunately gotten lost in transit AGAIN.

They try to paint the picture that they are very helpful through the live agent chat function but in reality, their agents are very deceitful and over-promise to try to paint themselves in a positive light. One example- on one occasion where I told the agent that my item will be delayed as based on tracking, it clearly showed that the item was still stuck in the warehouse- he said ""no worries I will issue a ticket for you and my colleagues will get back to you within 2-4 days"". After 1 week when I checked back on the chat, their agents said ""oh sorry the ticket submitted was not processed"".

In the end, when the packages are lost, they don't offer any compensation and merely tell you to either ""accept a refund"" or accept another reshipping. It is just very very very bad customer service as if telling you to ""suck it up"".",2021-09-29,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

They told me to print up a label & send back... I told them I can NOT do that. They said that`s the only way to RT items because they go paperless. They said wrap it back up & just RT to sender. The POST OFFICE says I can`t do that. Meanwhile, I am STUCK w the item... I don`t even rate them one star at this point! SHAN.",NA,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

FedEx instructed me to call Fanatics because only they could change the shipping address while it is in FedEx's possession. I contact Fanatics and they stated that their company policy dictates, 'If FedEx could not find the address, then they will return my package to stock and refund my money.' I am not asking for a refund, I want what I ordered. I paid for the package so why can you not call FedEx to change the delivery address in lieu of having to refund money; it is a simple phone call. You are supposed to be selling Major league items but you have middle school business practices. I had an issue with a Jersey I ordered 2 years ago and now I will NEVER order from these people again.

"Jozef H.","Youth personalized jersey ordered on December 10th, with an express shipping option (charged some 15+ € extra) that should guarantee the delivery by Dec 22nd, order sum 101,74 EUR.
When the status didn't change after 6 days (according to the information from the website 5 days are needed for processing personalized items) I tried to retrieve some details about my order. The online chat feels like fake or as a lottery at the best - irrespective of the daytime, length and count of attempts, the only answer I ever got was that all the ""fan advocates"" are busy and I should try later/restart my request sequence.
On Dec 22nd (originally promised delivery date) I answered the order confirmation e-mail, which reads ""NHL shop Europe"" and ""customer services"" only to find out, the actual sender address is a no-reply one.
Resent the message to the customer service address from the body of the order confirmation message. Failed again, because the address contains a mistake.
Went to the website to find out the correct customer services address, sent the message again, basically saying that delivery till Dec 24th would be accepted despite the delay, for the delivery by 28th of December I would require refund of the ""express delivery"" extra fee, later delivery is not accepted, I want to cancel the order and require full refund.
No answer, no status change until a message on Dec 31st (9th day after my message) thanking me for the loyalty and informing, that the order should be delivered by January 7th.
On January 2nd I received a notification from DHL, that informs me about customs clearance and requires an invoice, a screenshot/detail of the bank transfer/card payment and full powers for DHL for the customs clearance. I had to generate one special document, because the sum of items in my order differed for no apparent reason by 0,01 EUR from the total/paid sum (twice fill in, download, print, sign, scan, upload).
I'll probably look at additional 16 EUR customs clearance service fee, because NHL Europe's seat is - outside EU.
Honorary mention - the provided DHL download page for the required forms is identified as phishing by browsers and security software, so I've got hard time to reach it.
According to the DHL tracking my order was announced on Dec30th and shipped on Dec31st, which is the 8th resp. 9th day after my written complaint and 3 days after the date of order cancelling deadline passed.
Summed up: total costs of about 118 € for one personalized youth hockey jersey, delivered 2 weeks after Christmas despite initial promise, zero communication/feedback/response, additional administration caused by regional sales office seated outside EU. Thank you, but no, thank you.

The thread count was so thin you could literally see your hand through the material. These products are a cheap as a $6 shirt from Walmart yet they charge $30.

"Joel C.","Initially making my first purchase from MLB.com was disappointing. Not only did I make sure to enter the correct mailing information, but also checked back to make sure however not only did I not recieved my order due to ""an undeliverable address"", but speaking to two other representatives I was offered no level of understanding, accommodation, or rectification odd the issue. I recieved a half hearted attempt at an apology, 10% off and a refund (when my item is finally recieved back at the warehouse). Not to mention I ordered my item on the 6th, and was given a delivery date of the 17th. Almost two weeks? Really? I know I didn't pay for expedited shipping, but that's ridiculous. So after waiting over a week and still not recieving a status update I finally decided to call and luckily was serviced by Cynthia (a real testament to TRUE customer service!) Not only was she able to identify with what had happen (not that all reps have to personally, but it helped), but she was more than accommodating in not only reordering the original product, but also making sure personally that the shipping label was correct (as the customer has no control over what the computer auto corrects to, defaults to, or interpretsatfter you submit your information). She also applied a discount to my order and expedited the shipping at no extra cost! All of this while being friendly, courteous, understanding, & NOT acting like she was inconvenienced or ""hands were tied"" as to resolving the issue. Whoever her supervisor is should literally stand up in front of everyone at the next meeting or go to the person who makes the most money in that entire building and read this out loud! CYNTHIA IS THE SOLE REASON I WILL CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS WITHIN MLB.COM AND WILL ALL FOR HER PERSONALLY NEXT TIME I (CALL TO PLACE MY ORDER)! THANK YOU CYNTHIA!

It's Monday, March 11. They sent me a promotional email for some ATL UTD labeled St. Patrick's Day items this morning.

I obviously want it by St. Patrick's Day so I paid for two day ""Shipping & Handling"" to be sure I would get it in time.

Shortly thereafter, I get an email telling me that I will ship it in four business days. Huh?

So I call their ""customer service"" (hah!) to check on the order and they tell me it will take four days to ""process"" and after that it will be two days until I get my order.

On top of it, the ""customer service"" agent was rude and unapologetic. I pointed out that every other online retailer in the world who commits to two day shipping and handling if that's what you pay for... Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy...

Marner jersey received is great. Customer Service is NOT, despite their being ""committed to my satisfaction"".

1) Had to order a custom jersey (more $$) just to get the A on Marner's jersey.

2) Mobile site (where I ordered) says flat shipping of $4.99. Regular website says something different. They would not honour what they posted on their mobile site. THEIR mistake but won't correct it.

3) Was told if item goes on sale within 15 days of purchase, they would honour sale price. I originally bought at 20% off. 2 days later was 25% off so I contacted customer service right away. After 2 days emailing back and forth of them claiming it was on a different site, they said i was supposed to contact them on 1st day of sale. What? Where is THAT bogus unwritten rule? They finally relented saying they would do it on a one time basis and give me the additional 5% off. But they have me 5% off the already reduced 20% off. I know math very well. That is not 25% off and I still paid tax on the original amount so in the end they still were off the mark. They did not keep their commitment to honour the sale price.

That sounds pretty exact and without exception. But trust me, there is a big one: items shipped directly from the manufacturer must be returned within 30 days. That policy is buried several screens away, and with no hint in the big, exact message that there are exceptions, a buyer is stuck with no recourse to a loophole (or outright lie) to the big bold policy. For me, an early Christmas shopper, this means I cannot return wrong-size gifts because I bought them 30 days before the person received them, tried them on, and found them not fitting.

"Frozen-in-MN D.","My workplace is doing Team Spirit Casual Fridays until after the Super Bowl. Prior to last Sunday's Minneapolis Miracle, I wasn't a football fan. I do, however, love me some casual Fridays.

Living in Minnesota means that Vikings wear is r̶e̶q̶u̶i̶r̶e̶d̶ encouraged. Problem is, due to my former not-a-fan status, I didn't own any Vikings gear (or any NFL gear for that matter.) Sunday's Minneapolis Miracle ensured that any store within a 50-mile radius is sold out of Vikings gear. So I did what any rational b̶a̶n̶d̶w̶a̶g̶o̶n̶-̶j̶u̶m̶p̶e̶r̶ new fan would do, and turned to the interweb for all of my Team Spirit Casual Friday needs.

I came across the fanatics website and it looked promising. Team gear in extended sizes? Check. Reasonable prices? Check. Free and fast delivery? Check! So I found a shirt that I liked and ordered it. As soon as I pressed the order button, I experienced instant buyers remorse. It was too good of a deal, and I had never heard of fanatics before, and I worried that it was too good to be true. So I again consulted the interweb and found this site and my stomach dropped after reading the reviews. I tried to cancel my order but it was already in process, so I decided to hope for the best knowing that I could always file a dispute with paypal if my item never came.

Much to my great surprise, my shirt was delivered yesterday, as promised! I received the item and size that I ordered, and I couldn't be happier!

Ordered a jersey Sat 4/20, received package Mon or Tues of following week. It was the wrong jersey. Called customer service (shop.nhl.com - sister company to fanatics) and customer service rep seemed uncaring & treated it like any typical request for an exchange. I said I needed correct jersey asap via expedited shipping to receive prior to a flight on Thurs 5/2. The rep never told the manufacturer/vendor to send it to me expedited shipping. The replacement was sent to me via regular ground shipping - set to be delivered the day of my flight out of town. Had to have FedEx station hold it there for me to pick up prior to my flight. Opened the package at FedEx and AGAIN it was the wrong jersey and also in the wrong size. I called Fanatics cust service reps and they gave no option to even do another replacement and said could only ""request' to the vendor that the ""vendor"" reply regarding what THEY want to do about it. Not acceptable. Then I called Fanatics corporate office phone # and left a message. Also went on better business bureau website and submitted email to Fanatics through there requesting that corporate office call me by phone. To my surprise on Mon 5/6 a ""Supervisor - Fan Relations"" named CHASITY SANCHEZ called me - very nice - and ensured me that she would get me the correct jersey. She said she had a team who had direct contact with the ""vendors"" and they would make sure the correct jersey was sent to me. I told her I could not stand the possibility of opening a 3rd wrong package and asked that they have the new correct jersey (3rd attempt) sent overnight directly to her desk first for her to inspect. And if she saw it was correct with her own eyes then she could overnight it to me. Well she said that was no problem. By Tues she had a response from the vendor that they were sending her the correct jersey overnight. By Wed she had it in her hands and it was correct! She inspected it and sent it to me. And by Thurs morning it was at my house - correct jersey! WITHOUT CHASITY SANCHEZ ""Supervisor - Fan Relations"" I know I never would have gotten the correct jersey - ever. Thank you so much to Chasity - and a I hope this is a learning experience for Corporate that they need to fix some things on their end to avoid these issues in the first place.

I recently ordered a jersey that was a special order item while it was ""in stock"" - I followed that up by buying a hat the next day. I got order confirmations and numbers but after a few days of hearing nothing about either order and their statuses marked as 'pending' online I chatted with support, who told me to call, who then told me both my orders were cancelled. Why? They needed time to figure it out but it was my FOURTH cancelled order in a row (I had the same experience with the nba shop a year previous with no explanation). Their explanation was that my wife had ordered something years ago with her name with my email and a different shipping address (so I guess don't ever move) and now my orders were all marked as fraudulent because of a different name, address, card number (I payed by paypal so no idea why this would matter). The resolution to all of this was to offer me 20% off my next order (wouldn't that just get cancelled?) and tell me there was no way of honoring my original order because the item is now sold out. I cannot believe any company could get away with practices like these and still continue to represent merchandise sales for major sports leagues and teams. The phone people were courteous but did nothing to resolve the situation equitably.

"Greg F.","After my last review, fanatics did the right thing by deciding to reimburse me for the entire amount that I paid. I eagerly took this money and went back to the fanatics website to buy a Browns shirt that's the correct size. Since XLT (Extra Large Tall) was so baggy that two people my size could have worn it at once, I obviously needed to go a size down. As it turns out, they don't sell any LT (Large Tall) tees and the only clothing items they sell in that size are goofy orange polos! Since they don't have LT shirts, I thought that maybe the regular large would suffice. I ordered the shirt, put it on only to look down and see my stomach hanging out. I returned the large tee and ate the eight dollar shipping fee after all. I find it comical that there is such a gap in sizing. I'm a tall, athletic person (Think basketball shooting guard... 6'6' 230 with wide shoulders and no gut hanging out) so I don't always have the best time finding clothes; however, its absurd that their sizing goes from belly tee shirt to cape.

The t-shirt was very thin, almost see-thru and the printing on the front and back was so faded in colour it looked like it had been washed 50 times.

I started off trying to return a damaged product. The service rep offered to ship a replacement with expedited shipping, which i initially agreed to. But then she said it would take 3 business days. That doesn't really sound like expedited shipping to me, so I immediately told her to just process it as a refund. She had jumped the gun and processed it as an exchange. I told her to cancel it and I was told that is impossible. That is absurd. It took almost 2 weeks for me to receive my initial order, and you're telling me the replacement shipped within 30 seconds?

Perfect! What I wanted to buy qualified. NOT! The gift card was only valid at Fanatics.com but the exact same jersey (same item number & everything) was $59.99 on Fanatics.com. After chatting online with someone, then calling, then calling again because I was confused at what the first caller told me (almost 2 hours with these people) they told me they couldn't help me. ""The system"" won't let them do anything & there were no managers to talk to. My choice was to pay more & use my gift card code or pay less but have a useless gift card.

I called to tract the order and they said on the phone that it was scheduled for a delivery 10 days after originally promised. I said that it wouldn't be in time for his birthday. It actually did come the day before and I was horrified! Not only did they screw up the name, they said it was my fault and there would be no refund or return.

Screen prints are crooked... to high or too low located on shirt. Off center by a lot. It make you wonder if the people doing the printing are crossed eyed or something... really bad. Fanatics was good back in the day over a decade ago... but today they are nothing more than about quantity and not quality. What ever your team college or pro you are better off contacting a local fan gear center or bookstore at the University of your choice or pro team home location.

Their website didn't recognize my order# or email address so I opted for the live chat. Even after attaching and sending a copy of my order confirmation, they still were unable to help locate the order. Unbelievable!

"Kathleen M.","I ordered a Father's Day gift on June 5 thinking I had plenty of time for it to get to my parents' home in 12 days. After learning from my mom it had never arrived, I called Fanatics to see what was going on. I was told there was a delay in the order (Why hadn't anyone reached out to me before to let me know?) and was given no ETA even after almost 2 weeks. I received an email about an hour after I had called just reiterating the delay, but with no ETA so I responded to the email asking when I should be expecting it-one more week? Two more months? I never heard back so a week later, just called and cancelled my order. I was just given a Ticket # regarding the cancellation in case the return isn't processed within 5 days. I try to steer clear of Amazon whenever I can, but obviously I'll never use Fanatics again.",NA,NA,"Site Jabber",NA
"Lee W.","I recently placed an order (279-2247-9390) for 3 apparel items. It took a considerable amount of time, but not unreasonable, for the order to be processed and received. The men's button down shirt that I ordered was in my typical size in a standard fit, but it was a very tailored fit and was far too snug for my liking. I called customer service and they told me I had to use the online system. I called because I wished to exchange the item for a larger size, but they informed me that their company does not do exchanges, which is ridiculous for a clothing retailer to begin with. I chose to go ahead and process my item for return without an exchange in mind, only to find out that they charge an absurd $9.99 return label fee for me to return an item that I cannot use. It looks like I not only have to pay a fairly decent shipping price to receive the item to begin with, but I cannot exchange my attire for a different size and I need to pay an additional 10 dollars to return it. Hassle free returns? That is laughable. Fanatics has officially lost my business for the foreseeable future.",2019-05-06,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

"Joanna P.","Im very happy with fanatics. The order shipped within the timeframe given which was 3-7 business days. A lot of people here do not seem to realize that the days to ship and the shipping time can be different. When you select 2 day shipping that is the shipping from the moment it leaves the warehouse. With such a large number of wares that fanatics sells, it is natural that if you select something pretty obscure it will take time to be found, packaged and sold. This was my first order and i was pretty reluctant because of the reviews but i had a gift card and thought id give it a shot. The package actually got here 2 days before it was supposed to and its the right product. I will try it again just to make sure it wasnt a one time success. Overall i was very happy with the outcome",NA,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

When I called to get an update I was told that the items would ship several days after the anticipated receipt date. Upon hearing that I wanted to cancel the order.

"Tahir H.","Yesterday afternoon (07/23/18), I ordered a custom LA Dodgers jersey size Youth XL off Fanatics. I used a $70 VISA gift card, the total was around $56 as it was $52 with a coupon and about 4$ for shipping. I entered my address correctly but I caught a mistake with a glimpse of my eye as SOON as I pressed complete order. It said the city was Queens County BUT I what I really wanted to put was Queens Village. After doing some research, even with Queens County entered, it should still ship to my address so I didnt want to cancel my order just yet. I also didnt get a order confirmation email like most site I order off do. And now seeing reviews and comments I am very convinced that this site isnt very trustworthy. BUT, I have seen a few decent reviews that still give me
Hope that I will recieve my product on time and correct. It would be great if customer service would reply right now and if I get help and my product I will change this to a 5 stars.

Packing slip in one box was for some other person's order, so I had to call to get a return label and correct receipt.

Despite their ""365 day return policy"", am now finding out that some items were shipped from a different company and that company's 30 day return policy has expired.

"STEPHANIE V.","Horrible customer service, ghetto and careless
Horrible customer service! My goodness!
So I ordered two items from this website IN TIME for it to make for Christmas. But unfortunately on my part I had typo when Placing the order on my address. So FedEx contacted me (doing their part) explaining to me that due to the carrier (Fanatics) they couldn't not release the package to me, because they have restrictions. Now that's not even the issue because UNDERSTAND each company is just doing their JOB! But they made it seem like suchhhhh an easy fix, all I had to do was get ahold of the carrier and have them contact FedEx with the OKAY to release the package.
Ok so I call, the 23rd automated system hangs up on me 3 times... then I try chatting with customer service, I got two ppl and both disconnected with me finally I got a third person and they told me that the package was already to far out and that they couldn't do anything. I explained the situation. How I was told to contact them. And they would give my package. The representative said she's never heard of such thing! WHAT?
The 24th so I try picking up the package in person, but due to me just moving in to this address my I'd is not updated. FedEx won't release it to me and once again explains to me that all I have to do is call the carrier to contact them. Which. I explained I already tried and nothing. So I step outside and try calling the customer service number, I get connected I tell the girl the situation, she rushes to put me on hold to ""find out ""what she can do. Didn't even ask for my order number? And then I'm disconnected. Then I call again ( I'm determined I really had hope they would help me) I get this ONE gentleman who I wish I would of gotten his name because he was willing to go the extra mile, he told me to try doing a Congress call (3way) with him and FedEx in the process I lost him.
So I call a third time. Another gentleman who automatically tells me there's nothing they can do. Not even asking for order number again. Is talking over me supertrrr ghetto oh my god. So I said can I speak to a manger please he said ok but she's just going to tell you the same, I said let me speak to a manager. The manager gets on the phones says it's above her, she can't do anything. I told her THEN WHY WOULD FEDEX TELL ME TO CALL THW CARRIER. She said it's what ""their suppose to say ""what! What does that even mean? If that's the case just tell your customers they won't get they're packages, that it'll be returned and refunded and they'd have to order AGAIN. They disconnected me I called on last time same thing I asked the manager how ONE representative was willing to go the extra mile, BUT SHE WONT? I'm so upset goodness so up set. These people are careless. I work in customer service for over 10 years I go above and beyond and if I can't help i FIND someone that CAN! Horrible experience, I'm still mind boggled at how no one managed to contact FedEx for me. Ghetto, careless, sarcastic people is who they have answering to customers problems.

When I gave her my order ID she told me that wasn't the right number or I couldn't read the number right... what! I told her I had a copy of my order (FLASH). I was lucky that I had saved it. She slyly told me to copy it and email it to customer service (she gave me the email address) and it would be taken care of. I did this and guess what, I got an email from their customer service that they could not answer questions through email and I would have to call the company. I tried to call back, was on hold for over 25 minutes then, I asked for a supervisor, after another 15-20 minutes on hold I got a supervisor. She apologize and told me to contact her directly with my FLASH add, which I did. She did credited one of the items 30%, the copy I had. She said all she could do was 20% off on the rest of my order, which should have been 30%. She asked me if I would like to take a survey and just to stay on the line, I was disconnected. I call once again that evening to try to get my additional 10% off and yes I had to wait and then the person I spoke with was very rude and disconnected me again and I didn't even get to take their survey again!

I mainly love fanatics for their hats. I am a huge hat collector and have almost 100 new era 3930 hats. I would say 90% of these hats came from here. Fanatics is the go to source for the 3930 line. Lids has a few but they are more geared to sell 5950 hats. I have only had an issue with one hat and return was a breeze and didnt cost me a dime. They even sent out another hat as soon as the return hat was entered into the postal tracking system.

Customer service is extremely friendly and is fluent in English! They also have a reward system where you earn cash the more you shop. If you have a Jc penny credit card you can also order from fanatics through jcp website and charge to your card that way. They also take PayPal which is another plus.

And shipping? I've always gotten free shipping from these guys! I think there is a 50 minimum but they usually have specials going on where you get it free. Shipping times? Lightning fast!

Fanatic website said delivered on 12/20. No package. Called Fanatics and they said ""Oh, this happens sometimes. The website says delivered but its still on the truck. Give it another few days"". Ok, we did as they asked and I also opened a inquiry with the shipper, LaserShip.

Christmas eve, no package.

12/26 received an e-mail from LaserShip declaring the package lost.

Called Fanatics on 12/30 and was told ""We'll be happy to reship the order and refund your expedited shipping but the guarantee to arrive by Christmas does not apply since the package showed as delivered in our system"". Told them we had confirmation from the carrier that it was declared lost but was told that didn't make a difference.

So much for their delivery guarantee. Rules changed at the 11th hour to fit the misinformation in their system.

Sent *******@fanatics.com an e-mail on 12/30 requesting a refund because they did not meet the delivery guarantee.

Opened a PayPal dispute on 12/30 with the same information that was sent direct the Fanatics.

As of today 1/11/18 I have not received a response to either.
I guess they only respond to negative reviews (within hours from the looks of it) so I'm trying here.

Fanatics.com - Please don't respond telling me to call you. Please just issue my refund or e-mail me if you want copies of the e-mail from LaserShip that your person on the phone was not interested in seeing.

So I decided to cancel the order, which the most recent emails say I can do. I called customer service, only to be told that they can't actually cancel the order and refund my money. Supposedly they can only ""submit a claim to cancel the order"". Then, they have no control over whether the claim is approved or not. What a convenient response. In the meantime, I'm still out over $100 and have no merchandise, nor does it appear I will ever be receiving any merchandise.

As my son's birthday was just a couple of days away, I called Fanatics customer service, assuming they would right their wrong and do all they could to ship me the correct jersey ASAP. But... nope, the customer service rep simply told me that it is my responsibility to first return the jersey to them before they can send me out a new one in the correct size and that it ""could take up to 20 days""! Credit to them for sending the orginial (incorrectly-sized) jersey in 5 days time BUT no apology was offered on their behalf, nor was there any way to get the right jersey sent to me in time for my son's birthday, or at least expedite the process a bit to make amends. I understand that customizing a jersey can take a little extra time and was prepared for that, what bothered me was Fanatics complete lack of ownership of THEIR error and obvious disinterest in fixing THEIR mistake in any timely fashion. Also, the return process is cumbersome and time-consuming on the customer's end and with all the other options out there for fast shipping & far easier returns (a pre-printed return postage label included in the packaging would be easy to generate and much easier for the customer to deal with), etc., plus the prospect of better customer service, I see no reason to order anything else from Fanatics again.",2018-07-26,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

Called Fanatics and they told me there was nothing that could be done and that they were out of stock of the item I ordered. They further stated they would give me a refund, but that has yet to come through either (it was paid via PayPal, so it should be instant). Fanatics ruined a once in a lifetime event for me.

This isnt the first time they have burned me on slow shipping, I should have known better. Never again. ***added after fantics.com response***Awesome response fanatics.com to my original post, only thing you failed to mention is I ordered on May 31 and here it is June 10 and I still don't have any of the shirts I ordered. At least own up to your false delivery delivery projections and quit blaming the consumer. Maybe I could pick the correct delivery method if i knew it was going to take half a month to get playoff shirts. Never again! I'm better off buying the bootleg shirts than waiting on your delivery. Playoffs are over, no shirts yet to be seen, already set up return and the shipment hasn't even arrived.

I ordered after 8PM on November 14th knowing I needed to have them before we left Pittsburgh for Myrtle Beach on November 25th. After reading some reviews I started to panic, especially after not receiving a confirmation e-mail.
By Sunday I was in full panic mode and decided to do a customer service chat and cancel my order. Well... during the chat we realized that I had put an extra ""I"" in my email address and that was the reason I hadn't received a confirmation. I actually found out the order had already been processed and was being shipped! I received my order on November 17th and this was without asking for any special shipping requests or charges. I will definitely use this company again! The customer service rep (Khadijah A) was super nice even when it had been determined that the issue was my fault. I took note of the name in case I had an issue with the service even though the exact opposite was true.

"Melanie S.","Two words to describe Fanatics: lying and deceptive. This is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had with a company. They deserve zero stars. I placed my order ensuring that I chose items that had the ""guaranteed delivery by 2/2 or its free"" so that I would have them in time for the Super Bowl. Needless to say, I did not receive my items in time for the Super Bowl, but I also did not receive them free. When I called and spoke to customer service, they acted oblivious to the fact that this guarantee even existed, and said that they couldn't find it anywhere on my account even though my order email clearly shows that I did order my items under this promotion. Instead, they offered me a small discount, and 30% off of my future order. This future order is never going to occur, because I will never order from Fanatics again after this ridiculously uncalled-for situation. I also emailed the company explaining to them how irate I am about their lack of service quality and deceptive nature. Their response involved explaining to me that they already gave me a small discount on my order for this situation, but that they would provide me with an additional discount to mitigate this issue. Do I believe that I will ever see any amount of refund from this company? No, I do not. They already blatantly lied about providing a full refund if I did not receive my order by 2/2, and assume that they can lessen my irritation by providing me with a sugar-coated afterthought to smooth over their wrongdoing. The problem here is with the trust that I no longer have with this company. They did not fulfill their promise in any way, and I have lost complete respect for them. All I wanted was my order to arrive on time for the Super Bowl. This did not occur. I got nothing but the runaround when trying to communicate with them or their delivery service LaserShip. Fanatics is just utilizing a diversion to shy away from the real issue here: They have no appreciation for their customers, and have undoubtedly lied through their teeth.

Hello Michael, thank you for your feedback! I am very sorry that the item didn't arrive as expected. Our number one concern is customer satisfaction. The item was scheduled to arrive from the manufacturer to our fulfillment center by no later than 2/2/2018. Unfortunately, these items were not delivered as intended. The manufacture has no informed us that it will ship on or before 2/6/2018. Our Guaranteed to Get there promotions were on orders placed prior to 1/16/2018. However, our site was offering to try to get all the Super Bowl items delivered by no later than 2/3/2018 in time for the game. Once again, I apologize for any frustration this may have caused you. Sincerely, Julian",NA,NA,"Site Jabber",NA
"Greg M.","They sent me the wrong jersey twice and they wouldn't exchange it. I had to buy a new ome and return the old one. I had to ship it back on my own dime. The customer service is horrible I had to speak with a manager just to get them to pay for shipping back a second time. What kind of online company doesnt do exchanges? They are a horrible company. Buyers BEWARE.

Hi Julian,

I don't care why you can't do exchanges. Obviously your system is not equipped for an online environment. Every other company I deal with online does exchanges. Fanatics is the worst just close up shop. Look at the negative reviews you get NO ONE likes your company.",2018-06-05,NA,"Site Jabber",NA
"Chavis W.","Ordered a hat and shirt for the super bowl on January 25th. I did realize that it was a special event item and would not ship until 1/31 in which it did. But my issue is that I don't understand why fanatics used two different shipping methods for my items. One of my items is being shipped FedEx ""smart post"" which has my item slated for a 2/6 delivery date which is well after the super bowl. My second item is being shipping FedEx ""home delivery"" and is slated to arrive tomorrow. This is the second time I've had issues with fanatics. I'll be looking elsewhere for my fan gear next time.",NA,NA,"Site Jabber",NA
"Hannah H.","Awful isn't even a profound enough word to describe this hideous and cringeworthy company. I ordered a size small and they sent me a size medium. I needed to wear the shirt for an event the following day, so there was no opportunity to return it and exchange it. I counted on this piece-of-excrement company and they let me down. I will NEVER, EVER buy another article of clothing from them. And will personally make sure that none of my friends, family, or any other acquaintance of mine buys their products either. So beyond livid at this deplorable company. I didn't know how pathetic company could be until I encountered them. DESPICABLE.",2017-04-29,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

I didn't make a big deal I understand it's a busy season it was fine. Day after Xmas nothing got delivered instead the item was sent back to warehouse. At this point I just wanted a refund since this was a gift. Was told they needed the item in warehouse and then I could expect a refund up to a week later. Fast forward to 1/10 live assistance told me they had actually just issued the refund and would take 2-7 days. Well it's now 1/22 and still no refund has been issued.

"Thomas B.","Just another bad review for Fanatics... Unfortunately, this company (under various names) seems to have nearly complete control of the online sports apparel market via university and major pro league shopping sites. I ordered two tee shirts from MLBshop.com - a long sleeve (US$30) from Fanatics and a short sleeve (US$22) from Majestic. Poor reviews from many review sites had me concerned; although most problems seem to be related to shipping delays and customer service issues. I figured I'd do a small order to test the waters, with no urgency involved and an order that would be pretty hard to screw up. I received the products in a reasonable timeframe. However, the quality of the LS tee from fanatics is poor. The material is very thin/light (immediate wrinkling/warping on the first washing); the stitching looks like it will start raveling after about 20 washes (will have to wait to see); the printing is poor quality and looks like it will be distressed after a handful of washings; the ends of the long sleeves have no elastic (I could see this in the photo on the site, but I would have expected some reasonable reinforcing other than a 1/2"" turn under with lousy stitching); and to add insult to injury the printing (arch with straight line on bottom) is not level. I'm not sending it back - but from reviews that I've read and from my experience, it appears that Fanatics quality and that of it's affiliated brands is probably uniformly low. For $30, they should provide something much better. I get similar (thinner than normal material, sketchy printing) LS shirts with local university sports logos from WalMart for $10-$12 that are of far better quality. The Majestic SS tee was pretty thin/light also, but stitching looks a little better, and the printing looks like it will last for a while (at least it's not crooked). Be warned in terms of your expectations. Someone is making a ton of money for nothing.",2018-04-14,NA,"Site Jabber",NA
"Fred F.","Web site said 3 business days to process the order plus 3 days transit time. They created my Fed-x tracking number on time and sent a message telling me to wait by the door. Yeah right.

I did not receive the shirt until late July after calling customer service several times and STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED the hoodie. They did send me one hoodie last week, but it was a Medium, which is not what I ordered and way to small. I have called customer service several times and they have said that it is impossible to get this hoodie in the right size in Canada... imagine that... a Canadian fan wanting merchandise for a Canadian team. They say they have the hoodies in the US but are unable to bring one over the border. Their solution would be for me to re-order the hoodie from the American site, and pay the exchange rate and shipping... cause this is my fault right? Why would I be punished for their mistakes.

I truly cant wrap my head around how they can promise Canadian fans merchandise for the ONLY Canadian team in the league and not come through with the product.

After I was on hold 30 minutes waiting to speak with someone I played around on the internet and went to laserships website pretty interesting all of the reviews are of packages coming up ""lost"" one other one even stated is was a sports order such as mine! So a rep from lasership gets on the phone and tells me they are deeming it lost as well! GREAT since were 4 days after delivery date and not one person from either company decided maybe to reach out and say hey heres what happened here is how we are going to fix it. I had to call all over god's green earth just to be told there isnt anything anyone can do.

When I started using A VPN they cancelled every order even though I had ordered things in the past and had them shipped to the very same address and used PayPal. The first time it happened, I called and they said that it was a problem with my address. What it was, with a VPN your IP address is encrypted and they can't match it to your physical address. But, anyone with a shred of intelligence would know that it was being shipped to the same physical address as my past orders so how could it be fraud? They assured me at that time that it would never happen again, but sure enough the same thing happened again on a subsequent order.

Anyway, after listening through the options I was shortly routed to a representative. She was very pleasant and professional, but she explained there was no where to mark exchange on the return form because they do not do exchanges just returns. I never heard of such a thing. She continued, I must return the order and place a brand new order. The refund would occur within 10-14 business days. What a hassle! I think I'll speak to my daughter about keeping the gifts.

I ordered two shirts, and both have issues, Customer service basically said you are screwed.

The first a women's medium shirt. Shirt was delivered on time, but was extremely small for a medium. I called customer service to return it and was informed that they will not take it back as it is a custom shirt. They will have the vendor (another company that makes the shirts for them) reach out to me. I am still waiting.

The other shirt a men's x-large sizing was good, but the front logo has nice bright colors and the back logo is all faded and looks like it has been washed 100 times. Again the same response from customer service, they will not take it back or give a refund.

These were not $10 t-shirts, They were over $30 each. At that price I would expect a quality product and good customer service. Seems fanatics is out for the one time sale and not repeat business.

Also upon receiving the product and wanting to return the site would not recognize my e-mail address or order #, so I had to actually wait on hold and talk to customer service. Once I actually spoke to customer service they verified the e-mail address and order #, but told me they will not issue a refund or return.

This seems to be the second strike, Poor product and poor customer service.

So here I sit writing a review. Out $80 for 2 shirts one that does not fit and one that is faded. Maybe Someone from Fanatics will respond to this review and help workout a solution.

After reviewing this site and seeing all the negative reviews for Fanatics I wonder how Major League Baseball allows them to continue to produce trademarked product. You would think that the MLB would at least vet the vendors and partners they set-up and authorize the use of the brand.

So your package gets to your city via FedEx and then they transfer it to the USPS to deliver to your given address, which for some reason adds 2-3 or 10 days. My order for some reason got auto returned. No joke. I never saw it, touched it or had it in my possession and it is being returned to sender as of my last update. After all my time talking, holding, submitting claims, and even trying to go into a local post office I have decided to ask for a refund. I get, "" we are so sorry... of course. Blah."" then I get an email I forming me it will be another roughly 20 plus or minus days for me to get my money back for processing. This is ridiculous! I should have saved myself and just gone to an NFL shop and gotten a jersey there... seriously don't risk it!",2018-12-14,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

"Alexander L.","I contacted their chat representatives 3 times and each time was terrible. My biggest concern is that I ordered items that said, ""Ready to Ship"" (or something similar) thinking that'd mean it would get shipped out quickly and in time for Christmas. However after speaking to a chat representative today I find out that the date my items will get shipped out will be delayed and arrive after Christmas.
I should not have had to find that information out through contacting them, they should have sent out a notification stating that there might be order delays, even if you ordered within the ""Get it before/by Christmas"" Window.
Also, they don't provide proper status updates on your order, which is why I continue to contact their chat representative. I was hoping to make adjustments to my order since one chat representative said no status means it hasn't been shipped but, the one I spoke to today said it's too far in the delivery process to change despite, the order not even been shipped out yet.
The chat representatives don't try to help you and all they seem to be able to do is apologize for the inconvenience which does absolutely nothing other than provide lip service.",2017-12-15,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

Very, very poor quality decals on shirts were not completely adhering to the shirt and peeling off. Contacted them and was asked to send them back. Needed them for an event so crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. They arrived just in time... but same exact issues. They had actually changed one of the decal on there because it was a problem but that too wasn't put on the shirt completelyt and was peeling. Part of one of the decals had been flipped and was on shirt wrong... and the front logo was also peeling just like the first batch. Called again... after lengthy conversation.

"Jake H.","Two years ago I purchased a Toronto Maple Leafs backpack for school with my birthday money. Within two weeks of its arrival, the zippers snapped off. I decided to just try and go on with the broken zippers, until they eventually completely snapped off. I called fanatics and spoke to the rude customer service providers, who reluctantly sent me a new backpack a few months later. Within a month of the new backpack arriving, the zippers completely snapped off again. I just decided to duct tape the zippers back on again to spare myself the hassle of dealing with customer service again. That worked out ok for a while until I got into high school later that year. With having to use my backpack so much the duct tape wouldn't hold. When I tried to contact Fanatics again, they rudely told me to go away since it had been past their return deadline, even though by the time I had received the new one it had not been. Then I tried to send Fanatics emails which they outright ignored. Finally, I tried to live-chat someone who works at Fanatics, but by that time, they said it had been over the date even though I had tried to reach out to Fanatics before that. Fanatics ended the live chat by terminating the connection while I was still trying to type back, proving that they do not care about their customers. Now I have to go spend more money on a new backpack that I shouldn't have to. I will never deal with Fanatics again now that I know I can't trust the products quality and that I am not at all significant to the customer service employees. I have contacted fanatics privately like they said and then all they could do was issue me a 20% off coupon. Do they really think I will spend any more money there.

Since I had used that gift card (remember the one I was stuck with because they 'couldn't' issue credit to the card I used on the previous order?) to pay in part, they would issue another gift card. Amazon credits me the minute UPS picks us the package. Fanatics likes to take over 2 weeks and then plays games with gift cards instead of crediting the card used to purchase.

"Robert A.","Sadly I will not be ordering from this website anymore. I love how they constantly have deals and coupons but my recent experience with customer service ruined it for me. I had ordered a Yankees hat with a Visa GIFT Card that I received for my birthday. The gift card was for $50, and after ordering the hat for $27.91, I used the card at another retail store. Once I was finished with the card, I ended up tossing it thinking I didn't need it. Now I understand I should have kept the card but here is where it gets messy.

Once I received the hat, it was way too small for my head. So I immediately got right into starting a return. Before I sent my return in, I contacted customer service and chatted with a representative about how I used a Visa GIFT Card and did not have access to it anymore. They told me it was no problem at all and to fill out a return form as a gift return and they would credit my money back as a gift card to their website.

So I followed their exact instructions and sent the hat out the next day. Fast forward two weeks (took forever) I contacted them to make sure things were okay with my return and they said yes. I then double checked to make sure I would be receiving a gift card and not money back to the original payment, and I was told yes. The very next day I get an email from them saying that $22.41 ($5.50 taken away for shipping) was refunded back to my original payment method.

I then called right away and explained the situation and I was told by a very rude rep that there was nothing she could do. I asked to speak to her supervisor and was essentially told the same thing. They gave me a visa number to call, and it wasn't even the correct number and I had to be transferred 3 or 4 times and on top of that there is nothing that the Visa Gift Card people can do for me. So I am not out $22.41, because Fanatics made the mistake of refunding me my money back to the original payment when I was told TWICE that I would be receiving a gift card. All I wanted to do was order the same hat just a different size, and I cannot believe that a company of this size would not be willing to credit me $22 for a mistake they made, especially when the money would have been going back to them.

A few days later my other order comes in which is just one Jersey and the name of the player is spelled incorrectly on the back! So again I contact the company they tell me that the item is out-of-stock I can return the product for free shipping and get my money back. Again no compensation! So twice they have made mistakes on their ends exclamation marks and twice they offer me nothing but to give me my money back which is great but no compensation for the mistakes that they have made! I even asked them can you at least give me my money back and let me keep the defective Jersey so I have something!? They said no I'm like okay it's probably just going to go to the trash. They said no we donate things. So again they want to give me their company and ordering from their company! But they want me to return the product so that they can donate it and get a tax write-off for donating things!?

Just talked to a customer service rep and the three days is only a ""rush"" on the customization and not actual delivery time and I should expect delivery in about six days. I've been in business for decades. When someone orders something overnight shipping it arrives after one night. Two day shipping arrives in two days.

Apparently (based upon the vast number of really bad reviews) the definition of shipping of Fanatics.com is detached from reality.

Response to Chastity/Brandon: I can tell you are really broken up about my negative experience. Since you said you would ""love to have a chance to make this right""... how about maybe using the package tracking number to reach out to FedEx and get it delivered? Then we would both be happy.

The order was processed on Monday and was shipped on Tuesday at 5pm per FedEx tracking info. So the ""shipping doesn't change processing time"" argument doesn't fly with me.

Every time i tried to log into my fanatic's account to set up doing a return it would tell me my email was invalid. I used the same email to order the product. So i sent Fanatic's an email and they sent me a return #. They wanted me to email them back the tracking # once i shipped it back. I used FedEx since that was what they used to send it to me. It cost $12 to return the package that i paid $4.99 for shipping.

That was another thing. It was supposed to be free shipping but it wouldn't let me put the code in to get free shipping when i ordered the case.

These fools failed, on EACH of three orders, to include the damn street number on my shipping address on the FedEx and LaserShip labels.

They would have to contact Fanatics. I called Fanatics. They refused to contact FedEx. They said they'd wait for FedEx to decide (at whatever juncture they deem appropriate) to send it back to them, before either crediting my card or resending the package. They would ALSO not expedite that shipping at their own expense to make it right.

This was absolutely absurd. Why would I give them more money, especially considering that they took my money the first time, and then canceled the order? I expressed this concern to the representative, and she said it would only take a few hours to refund. I told her I would call back then.
The next day, the money still had not been refunded. I called again, this time I was told that refunds took between 24 and 48 hours. Needless to say, I felt like I was being given the run around by this point. The 48th hour happened to fall on a Saturday, so I asked for clarity, if I should still expect to receive the refund in 48 hours, she said yes. Today is Saturday, still no refund! I called again today, and this time I was told that the money would be back Monday. I am done with this company! They are complete scammers! I never got a chance to actually see their merchandise, so I cannot comment on quality, but judging by all of the comments above mine, I think I dodged a bullet!",NA,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

"Michael F.","This was my first order - and last - placed with Fanatics. The artwork and copy on the Fanatics website is excellent. Every item on the site appears to be decent to high quality and worth the higher price. In fact, all six (6) t-shirts I ordered (and received) were of inferior quality. I expected the Fanatics 'house brand' to be a little cheaper quality and at a lesser price. I intentionally chose 100% cotton shirts with as heavy a weight as possible. Nevertheless, the Fanatics brand clothing is underwhelming and very disappointing. More surprising was the Mitchell & Ness ($39) and Majestic ($35) branded t-shirts - amazingly cheap crap by comparison to everything I've previously purchased from M&N and Majestic. It appears that Fanatics is paying them for using their brand name but using cheap crap. NOT WORTH IT.",2018-07-10,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

Secondly, VERY SLOW to ship, have only received 1 of the 2 items so far. But, the quality - WOW - extremely disappointed - the quality is so poor, the front ""decal"" looks like it is thrown on and the colours are awful. Does not even look like the team logo. ANd apparently ""customized items"" are NOT REFUNDABLE - so buyer beware, if it arrives and you are not satisfied, customized items are yours whether or not you like them. I paid $100.00 for EACH sweatshirt + shipping/taxes/etc. - NOT WORTH anywhere near it. You can buy better at your local sporting goods store and pay way less.

This was reasonable because I've ordered things from the US (such as Footlocker) and it came within 5-6 days. As I'm in Australia it used International Shipping and it shipped on the 16th of Feb.

It's now the 2nd of March and still not even an update of my package, only one saying its shipped on the 16th. Is it in Australia? I don't know. Is it even on it's way? I don't know. Has it been wrongly delivered? I don't know. I contacted Fanatics and asked to please explain why I have no idea where my package is and why it hasn't arrived after the 10 days they promised. They replied, ""they can't provide a status on the package because they don't track International orders"". I was furious so I replied ""how is that possible? Is there anyway to know where the *beep* my order is? How do I even know if it's in my country?"". They replied, ""sorry you just have to wait, give it three weeks"".

"Charles K.","I should have learned after the first time I ordered something from Fanatics and it never showed up and it took me over a month to get it resolved, but here I am again.

I ordered a jersey a month and a half before I needed it, it of course took forever to come which is just something I expect from this group so I figured I had plenty of time. The sizing guide suggested to order a size up for a looser fit which is what I like and of course the jersey looked like a dress on me, which is fine, sizing mistakes happen and that's no big deal.

This issue at hand is that I put this jersey in the mail to return on October 4th and after getting no updates from Fanatics from two weeks I reached out to a rep via chat and I'm being told I should have my refund by November 1st so I can buy my new jersey which will again take two weeks to ship unless I feel like paying more money for faster shipping. So many sites handle returns so smoothly and easily that this is just a huge disappointment. All I want is a credit to my account so I can get another jersey from them and knowing me I'd buy even more stuff from them for my team, but once this refund comes back I'll just take my business elsewhere.

Also at check out it went right to expediated shipping for $15 which I had to call to get them to credit, which they did and got the $5.99 price. Okay, get the hoodie, a YM is 12 to 14. Went online to their return page and it calculates your return credit. My total originally with shipping and tax was $32. They would credit my card $13. I guess now the hoodie was on sale for $18 and $5 was taken off for shipping. Will get him another somewhere else and keep this one for another time.

"Brittany L.","I recently purchased a Washington Capitals hoodie from Fanatics with Alexander Ovechkin #8 on the back. While it does say personalized in the description, in no way did I think that it was a ""customized"" hoodie as I simply picked a player from the drop down option and submitted my order. When the hoodie arrived, I found that it was too small, so I shipped it back to return. I did not hear from Fanatics for about 3 weeks, even though they say it takes about 7-10 business days to process the return once they receive it. I called after approximately 3 weeks as my tracking number said that the item had been delivered. At first, the customer service person told me that they had no idea where the hoodie was and that they would put in a request for someone to get back to me via email in 2-3 days. I waited 5 days and still had not heard back so I called again. This time they told me that my item was not going to be refunded as it was considered ""customized"". Keep in mind the name and number that I got on the back was the captain of their team, and likely the highest selling player of merchandise. I told them that I never would have sent it back if I thought it was customized and not returnable. After I realized they weren't budging on the refund, I asked when I would be getting my hoodie back. They said that it was my error and I would not be getting the hoodie back that I paid for, and that they would be donating it to a charity of their choice. In what world is choosing a player from a drop down menu considered customized?! I could see if I got my own last name put on the back of the hoodie, but their most popular player? Come on!

"Scott W.","Ordered 3 items on a Wednesday because I got a coupon from a Dunkin' Donuts coffee for 25% off any order. Found out they exclude sale items & you can't combine with free shipping over $29, which was annoying, but then they offered ShopRunner if you spend more than $75. Free 2 day shipping. Signed up for that (with the knowledge that it needed to be canceled immediately after, since it's probably a scam piggybacking this firm in the way it's laid out to reward people who spend more money, only to get locked into a shady contract that looks like a free year of fast shipping, which doesn't look like Amazon Prime's backwoods cousin at all), paid in full, and marked 2 day shipping. I tracked the order through the rest of the week and everything looked good.

Here we are 3 days later, package arrives and... only 1 item out of the 3. It's the wrong size and, hilariously to me, the only one I didn't need for tomorrow. There's no invoice or shipping manifest in the package (what the f$#%?), which tells me they have a terrible strategy in place for handling their distribution. The website offers almost nothing in recourse, the 'where's my item' section hasn't been updated in 4 years (and comically seeks to levy blame elsewhere if something is wrong), and calling customer service resulted in her immediately saying 'we'll re-ship it you and it'll be there in another 3 days' -- I wonder if she deals with this situation all day, every day, because that's what it felt like in how she responded.

At check-out page you see the coupon code, but if you don't click on Apply, it won't be effective. So, it's clearly trying to trick you. Anyway... Long story short, I thought I had free-shipping but I actually got charged a 1-day shipping of $15.99. One week later, I decided to click on my shipping email to check where the order was, and it still had 2 more days to go. So, first, I got charged shipping, I paid by accident $15.99, and 8 days later I still don't have the order. Which company charges $15.99 and not deliver next day? We should all stick to Amazon.
My first call to customer service, the lady told me that $15.99 was for 3 days shipping and it took 3 biz days to ship, and she wouldn't refund me.

"Brittany L.","I recently purchased a Washington Capitals hoodie from Fanatics with Alexander Ovechkin #8 on the back. While it does say personalized in the description, in no way did I think that it was a ""customized"" hoodie as I simply picked a player from the drop down option and submitted my order. When the hoodie arrived, I found that it was too small, so I shipped it back to return. I did not hear from Fanatics for about 3 weeks, even though they say it takes about 7-10 business days to process the return once they receive it. I called after approximately 3 weeks as my tracking number said that the item had been delivered. At first, the customer service person told me that they had no idea where the hoodie was and that they would put in a request for someone to get back to me via email in 2-3 days. I waited 5 days and still had not heard back so I called again. This time they told me that my item was not going to be refunded as it was considered ""customized"". Keep in mind the name and number that I got on the back was the captain of their team, and likely the highest selling player of merchandise. I told them that I never would have sent it back if I thought it was customized and not returnable. After I realized they weren't budging on the refund, I asked when I would be getting my hoodie back. They said that it was my error and I would not be getting the hoodie back that I paid for, and that they would be donating it to a charity of their choice. In what world is choosing a player from a drop down menu considered customized?! I could see if I got my own last name put on the back of the hoodie, but their most popular player? Come on!

Signed up for that (with the knowledge that it needed to be canceled immediately after, since it's probably a scam piggybacking this firm in the way it's laid out to reward people who spend more money, only to get locked into a shady contract that looks like a free year of fast shipping, which doesn't look like Amazon Prime's backwoods cousin at all), paid in full, and marked 2 day shipping.

The website offers almost nothing in recourse, the 'where's my item' section hasn't been updated in 4 years (and comically seeks to levy blame elsewhere if something is wrong), and calling customer service resulted in her immediately saying 'we'll re-ship it you and it'll be there in another 3 days' -- I wonder if she deals with this situation all day, every day, because that's what it felt like in how she responded.

I was never told before sending the item back that it was not returnable.

As a last resort, I asked to have the returned item sent back to me, but was told I would have to pay for the item.

This makes no sense. They kept the value of the prize I won and kept the item I returned. I acted in good faith and Fantatics refuses to do what is right and issue me a store credit.

I called and spoke with a supervisor (Tantaleah). She said that if Fanatics had sent the wrong size, she could help me but since the item didn't fit me, it was my ""mistake"".

The item was returned with tags intact and never worn. I paid $15 to return the item as well. I am completely appalled and disappointed at your response to this return. The sweatshirt ran entirely too small for this size given and was not able to be worn.

The Fanatics should take full responsibility for mailing the package and refund my full amount. Somehow they got the package back and send me a gift certificate valued at 1/3 of the original cost. Also, PayPal, so far has not held up their bargain to refund for items not received. I wish I had seen these reviews before ordering.

My 10 year old son tried it on and it didnt even fit him. Called customer service twice and both times was told that since its a customized product that they wont fix the issue. I spent $70 on this hoodie and now I can literally do nothing with it because its too small. Nowhere in the description did it say runs small and I read the size chart BEFORE I ordered. Horribly upset with this company, what a horrible way to do business. Apparently im too fat to do wear clothes. In the email response they state We hope to have the opportunity to serve you again soon for all your sports fan gear needs.

"Ryan M.","Placed an order on 10/29 and paid $14.99 for two day shipping to where to the game on 11/4. Contacted the business on 10/31 as it showed delivery was delayed until 11/1 (at this time they refunded shipping). I figured if it got here before the game, I wouldn't complain. Checked on 11/1 and delivery was delayed until 11/2. Checked on 11/2 and delivery was delayed until 11/3. I think you see where this is going... Checked on 11/3 and it is delayed until 11/4 end of business. I am leaving early morning on 11/4 so it defeats the purpose of spending the $130 on game-day gear. It seems as though I requested 2 day shipping and it was sent via standard ground. Contact customer service again on 11/3 to see if I would be able to pick up the shipment, they tell me I can call FedEx to check on that myself. I figured for the inconvenience, they could have called FedEx and followed up with me since it is their merchandise until I receive it. I have placed multiple orders with Fanatics over the last few years and have recommended them. I will not any longer and plan on returning the items as soon as they are finally delivered.

When reading other reviews, it's very difficult to believe that the shipping companies are the problem. I've seen a day or two delay, but 3-4 days isn't something I've experienced with a shipping company unless there is some form of disaster delaying delivery.

Update: Shipping label clearly says Ground shipping. So it seems like they were trying to make back a few bucks even after initially paying for 2 day shipping and then attempted to cover it up by saying FedEx sent it as ground. Returned merchandise, still in original packaging, back to Fanatics. They stated that they were unable to process a refund to my card (even though they previously refunded shipping charges) and instead gave me a credit to their site.

"Declan N.","What a terrible shame it is that a 0 star rating is not an option, as that would be more appropriate. This Christmas I have asked Santa Claus for a time machine, so I can travel back to the day I placed my order from this company and advise myself that swallowing razorblades would be a better use of my time and money.

My order was placed this order on the 26th of November 2018 and was advised I would have my items shipped within 1-2 working days of receipt of the order. 3 working days goes by and I receive no such notification. So I call their contact centre and speak to a member customer services team, Caroline, who advised me that their website had said 2 of their items they said they had in stock, they didn't. Even though they had taken my money and were perfectly happy to leave me in the dark with no idea when I would receive my items. She could not advise me as to when they would be in stock and because I needed these items before the 12th of December I wanted either to cancel my order in total and go to another provider or have the two items removed, have the rest of the order processed and then have the additional money for items they did not have in stock refunded to my card. But I made it clear that the most important priority was making sure they arrived before the 12th of December which, given the fact that was two weeks away at the time, seemed like a reasonable request. Naturally they wanted to go with the option that kept my money with them. She assured me that I would now receive the items and my partial refund within 5 working days.

8 working days goes by. No refund, no order received at my address. I call their contact centre again and I am cut off on 4 occasions before I can speak to an advisor. Then eventually I get to Rachel. Rachel advises me that she does not know why my order has not arrived and my refund has not been processed. But she was going to have this request sent to the ""Order Amendment Team"" (nice try by the way, very original) and they would be able to process my order and have it sent to me within (yup, you guessed it) 5 working days. I explained that I no longer had trust in the company and I wanted a refund. She then placed me on hold and spoke to her manager. After speaking to said manager she came back and said that she had now sent the request to management and they looked at this as a top priority and I would receive it sooner. I then asked why she didn't do the in the first place considering my circumstances and unless she could guarantee that I get the order before the 12th of December, as I was going to Germany, I wasn't interested in processing this order anymore and they had failed me on two occasions so I no longer wanted their merchandise. She said she could not guarantee when I would get my order and partial refund but I would 'definitely, probably, maybe get it in a few days"". After going back and forth for 20 mins and she referred to her manager on 4 separate occasions I explained that unless she could guarantee me that it would arrive by the 12th of December, i wanted my money refunded. She then agreed to do so and I ordered the goods from another provider. I received my goods the next day, so lovely and simple. Rachel agreed to refund me and said I would receive it with in 1-3 working days - which is nonsense, because a BACS payment to a debit or credit card takes 3 working days minimum. This company are terrible at setting customer's expectations. I don't look fondly on my time working in a contact centre before I graduated but I do remember one thing that was paramount: you do not lie to your customers and you always keep your promises.

The following week I am in Germany and I am notified that my next door neighbour has a parcel for me from Fanatics. I check my bank account and there is no refund even though they promised. I now have 2 sets of the same merchandise and Fanatics have taken my money.

I have made the decision to not pursue this any further. This may be their business model: to misinform, lie and take money from customers who do not know any better until they eventually wear them down to the point where they do not want their money back and are happy to live the rest of their lives without having to hear about them again. I am more than happy to do this. They can have my money as I feel safe in the knowledge that those people on the phones or in the warehouse are probably going to work everyday living in a miserable hell of an existence that they have created for themselves. I am also safe in the knowledge that I am not alone. On Sitejabber there are a total of 1484 reviews for this company and 1172 reviews are rated 1/5 stars, and it will be 1173 once I am done.

My main points I would like any potential customer to take away from this are:
1) This company misinform you deliberately
2) They do not keep their promises
3) Their employees are trained to lie to you and cut you off
4) They take your money and will not give it back
5) Their website is substandard for the purposes of ordering stock
6) There are companies out there with the same or better stock that value you
Keep their promises.

The two tumblers show up 4 days later and yet the baseball cap that was supposed to arrive in 2 days is still not here. Layer on top of that, one of the tumblers was the wrong item. Then I contacted customer service but they could not articulate the reason why everything was screwed up. They offered zero assistance in helping me understand what went wrong and they did not even attempt to make things right. They basically told me that I was S. O. L. And hung up on me. Yes - they hung up on me. Apparently, they don't care about their customers and I'll be surprised if they're in business much longer. My only regret is not doing my research and reading these other horrible reviews prior to making my purchase. And the worst part is - now I have to deal with their return process.",2017-10-27,NA,"Site Jabber",NA
"Luke A.","I ordered a Bucks Antetokoumpo jersey from New Zealand, but have a US postal address from NZ Post ""YouShop"", so it's legit. They took the order, took my money. Then a couple days later I got an email from ""Fan protection team"" saying my order had been cancelled and they were refunding my money. My money was refunded (after a few days), but they won't tell me why they cancelled the order! It's so frustrating, they keep saying I need to call them, but the one time I called I got cut off after mentioning I was calling from NZ. I tried to get an answer from their online chat, but they keep saying I need to call them. Just tell me why you cancelled my order! You can write it in an email or online, why do I need to call, unless you are a dodgy company, which after looking at some of the reviews on here, it seems Fanatics are about as unreliable as they come.:-(",2017-10-30,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

First off, they often use a company called ""LaserShip"". These guys are the absolute worst. One time, we had Fanatics (after being on hold with THEM for 26 minutes) contact LaserShip. And Lasership did not even answer the phone! When you track your order with Fanatics. Do NOT believe what you are reading. Honestly, Fanatics has no earthly idea where your order is. All they can do is give you ""Fan Cash"", thus guaranteeing that your next order will also be screwed up. Does Fanatics have a CEO? Maybe a group of folks who hold monthly meetings to talk about company issues? These guys should be embarrassed. We've already had an incorrect item sent to us, a lost order and a lost return. Oh, they also. For some reason, deleted my husband's account profile and put his orders in my order history.

It takes a full 7 days... thats the same as if it was shipping from CA. What makes it worse is that it appears the package is almost purposely delayed for using cheap shipping (not free but cheaper shipping... $5). It sat in the Fanatics warehouse for a day before a label was printed, then waited another day for it to be picked up, then sat locally for another day... In the end it will just be easier and cheaper to buy locally. They only win if they get your money.

My fiance didn't bring any of his game day gear because he had no idea we were going to the game.

I later called that night when nothing had shown up and the rep was hopeful it would come even though the tracking said it would not arrive until 12/27.

It takes a full 7 days... thats the same as if it was shipping from CA. What makes it worse is that it appears the package is almost purposely delayed for using cheap shipping (not free but cheaper shipping... $5). It sat in the Fanatics warehouse for a day before a label was printed, then waited another day for it to be picked up, then sat locally for another day... In the end it will just be easier and cheaper to buy locally. They only win if they get your money.

"Nicole A.","UPDATE ON REVIEW BELOW:
I was contacted by Julian as stated below and would like to recognize the serious effort of this company to make things right. I appreciated the discount and apology and think that the customer service of this company is excellent. It's the sizing and quality of the material that needs improvement.:)

I bought an NFL sweatshirt, size 2XL. I love oversized sweatshirts and being that I'm a female at 5'9 and a 135 pounds, the hem on a 2XL should hang to a couple inches above my knee. The sweatshirt I received fits like a large (which is fine but not what I wanted at all) but the worst part about this item is that it's a cheap iron on of my favorite team's logo and the quality of the material is that of a Hanes knock off and to boot, it took three weeks to arrive. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on delivery being that it was the holiday season. Whatever, delivery wasn't crucial anyway.

I called customer service and nicely suggested that they get some quality control on their products because it's very substandard. My item was custom so I completely get the fact that it wasn't returnable. I wasn't looking to return it, I just thought they should know how how awful the quality is.

The customer service person apologized and offered a 25% discount. Cool! I'll take that as well as knowing that I will never order from this company again.

I then got an email from the NBA store explaining that my NFL item is not returnable. Yea, I know that. After reading these reviews, I'm sure the discount will never be applied. This company needs massive rehab on the infrastructure if they want to succeed!",2018-01-12,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

"Kathy C.","Earlier this year (2017) I received a gift of a SF Giants shirt. The size wasn't right so I undertook to exchange it. The company doesn't do ""exchanges."" You have to return the item and start all over again. I queried the customer service rep about how the credit works. I didn't want the original purchaser to know I had exchanged the item. I was assured a credit would be set up in my name and the original purchaser would not know. I was told I would receive notification of the credit within a few days. After two weeks with no word, I called customer service again to ask about the credit. I waited on the phone for eons while the matter was being investigated, only to be told the credit had gone back to the original purchaser. Exactly what I did not want to happen. The credit was taken back from the original purchaser (talk about adding insult to injury) and put in a credit account in my name. Meanwhile the company bombards you with emails, always with special promotions: free shipping, no minimum order, 20% on merchandise, no minimum order. In early September I received a notification that if I didn't use my credit in 30 days it would expire. I live in California where gift cards, gift certificates and credits cannot have an expiration date. If no goods or services have been provided, these credits are good forever. Unfortunately, this company is elsewhere. To not lose the $65 credit, I placed an order totaling $62 today. The screaming banner of free shipping was this weekend's offer. When I checked out, I was being charged an additional $6.52. I'm not great at math, but if I use only $62 of a $65 credit and get free shipping, how do I owe an additional amount? So yet another phone call to customer service. Even though I was not applying for any other special promo, I was told that free shipping didn't apply to my order because I was using a credit. Dumbfounded, I asked why and was told it was just the way it is. If I purchased with a credit card and not used my credit (which will disappear in a week), I could get free shipping. Just to get rid of this company, I placed the order, paid the shipping. Meanwhile, they still have $3+ of my credit which I will never use. I expressed to the customer service rep that I will never, never, ever do business with this company again. If you are thinking of ordering from them, please don't.

They credited $18.74 to my credit card and the other $30 back to fan cash. I have requested the full amount be credited to my card (seeing as how I paid over $120 towards this order), but they refuse. This is fraud, in my opinion.

Pretty simple to understand, right? Apparently NOT. Instead, I received a size large Dallas Cowboy jacket. I called about this. I did not expect to receive my jacket by Christmas at this point. I am not crazy or unreasonable. I did expect them to honor their promise: that if I did not get the jacket I ordered by 12/23/17, it would be free. First, I was told it was not even available as it was out of stock. Second, I was told that no, I wasn't getting anything for free, and in fact, they asked me to print off a label so I could return the Dallas jacket. Finally, the customer service rep agreed to mail me a label. I'll still have to go to the PO or elsewhere to mail their package back to them. Now I am reading from other customers that I probably won't get the tax back, just the cost of the item, and I'll have to wait at least 2 weeks to get any of my money back at all. All I have to say is that they have not seen a level of angry yet until they stiff me out of money after what I have already put up with.

Customer order number ##193-2935-2760
Latino and Native American students are writing this complaint to you, in order to share our anger, disappointment and frustration with trying to purchase goods through your website! We are some of your biggest customers, especially the Raiders and Dodgers fans! We are very disappointed with your poorly organized website and service for our purchase for #193-2935-2760!
We bought a gift certificate for our work colleague. Your website wouldn't accept it. We personally called to place the order, but the first girl who answered, gave us attitude and wanted to sell us another gift certificate, rather then accept the one we already had! We asked to speak to a manager, we were put on hold. Got sick of waiting, hung up and called back. Kayla answered, she was very, very helpful and a STAR EMPLOYEE, but whoever writes the descriptions for your products is not very good at it - all the products sound the same, and the product code doesn't show up on iPhones (see attached photo as proof), which caused confusion for your staff and us. To be fair, Kayla did her very best with the information on hand and we appreciate it, but due to the confusing and poorly written descriptions, our order came up incorrectly. We had to call back again! We asked to speak to the manager, for some strange reason, your manager could not just fix our order and exchange the wrong hat placed in our purchase, for the correct hat that we wanted. The manager wanted to do it the hard way and have us to go through the entire ordering process, all over again! We only get 15 minutes for a work brake; After several calls (and emails which went unanswered), the order was now taking over an hour, and our boss was getting pissed off! Ordering a gift is meant to be fun and special, but with Fanatics, it is frustrating as hell for everyone involved! After an hour of aggravation and frustration, and now dealing with a Fanatics manager who wanted to make a difficult situation, more difficult, we took your managers advice and cancelled the entire order! It seems incredible that you have such an outdated website, which won't allow for a simple task of making a change, without having to reorder everything, ALL OVER AGAIN! Your website ordering service is horrible, as are the confusing descriptions, which sound the same for every product! There is no way in hell that using a gift certificate should be so ridiculously aggravating and frustrating! Your website manager, copywriter and marketing manager should all be fired, because you just lost a group of regular customers! From now on we'll be buying our gift certificates from your competitors, who offer fast and hassle free customer service!

A girl from your office called and left a phone number (*******782) which reaches NO ONE! What kind of joke is this! Your customer service horrendous and the customer service manager should be fired! We were good customers to you and you treat us like dirt! Disgusting!

As mentioned, we cancelled the entire order, now we want our money back for our gift certificate, because we sure as hell won't be going through that time consuming and aggregating ordering process ever again! How do we get our money back for the gift certificate!

Thank you for your time and we look forward to your reply.

"Jake B.","Ordered a few shirts on 6/12/18 for a birthday party on 6/24/18. If you think that 12 days will be plenty of time you would be wrong. My order was canceled with no update what so ever. No email, call, text, or even smoke signals given. I had to call in days later just to find out that my package wasn't even being shipped. I then replaced my order with customer service rep Clint on Wednesday 6/20/18. We changed my shipping to a two day shipping ""free of charge"" he said. My order was to be shipped to my office. When Clint refilled my order he put down my office suite # as the street address. He also changed my order from a business to a residential order which changes the delivery time to arrive after the office is closed. It is now 6/26/18, my package has been in town (Pittsburgh) since Friday 6/22/18. Now the only option I have to wait 3 more days to exceed FedEx shipping standers and will finally have the opportunity to go and pick it up in person. This completely eliminates the whole reasons for online shopping. Its funny how willing they are to take your money yet do nothing to help your situation when issues arise. Every comment on here is the same thing over and over again. It is clear that this is an issue that the company has no interest in fixing. SAVE YOUR MONEY. SAVE YOUR TIME. SHOP ANYWHERE ELSE. Whats funny is how right below this box is and ""Order ID"" section. I don't even know what my order number is because Fanatics refuses to send email updates or verification. Good luck to all who are just like me and didn't read the reviews before placing your order.",2018-06-27,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

Online it still says that my order is ""new"" and I'm not even sure if they have charged my card yet. Either way, it was supposed to get here within 3-7 business days and it has been longer than that.

The first shipment didn't go out for over a week from the time I ordered it and it was ""lost"" in the mail (I doubt that...). Anyway, I finally followed up with them and it took nearly another week to receive my order. When I went on online chat, it took forever to resolve because the chat rep was speaking to multiple people at a time.

"Elissa W.","Like others who have posted reviews on this site, I placed an order before Christmas using the promo code that was supposed to ""guarantee it by 12/23 or it's free"" and this was a total scam. Everything seemed to work fine while checking out and they made it appear as if the code worked. Days later, I emailed customer service because my package wasn't going to arrive on time and they said wait until after the holiday and call to request a refund. Package came late, I called for a refund, and the person I spoke to looked at my order and never said anything was wrong. She said she would process my refund and I'd get it in 2-10 days. Fast forward to today, I called to see where my refund was and they tell me the order never qualified and I wouldn't be getting a refund. After this switch, I emailed AGAIN requesting that someone look into this further because no one mentioned this when I contacted them 20+ days ago. I then received an email back saying I'd get a refund... then two hours later, I just got another email from someone else saying I wouldn't! Today's encounter alone shows how dysfunctional this company is and I'll never spend my money at a company who doesn't value my money the way I do. Tossing it back and forth saying I'll get it back and then I won't is so rude and unprofessional I'm truly at a loss for words. Never had a worse experience in my life...",2017-01-11,NA,"Site Jabber",NA

When I asked about getting the correct jersey in return they told me they were out of stock and there was nothing they can do. Not only was it dissapointing to hear that I couldn't get the jersey I ordered but the fact they want to offer me a savings for 10%! (Insert sarcasm). Sure I'll hop right on to buy some more items for your company to mess up. This not only ruined my day but it was a gift for my father.

"Susan D.","I ordered a $32 hooded sweatshirt for my son for Christmas. This week he came home and the zipper has come off of the sweatshirt, as though it were sewed on improperly. I contacted Fanatics this morning, both through chat and e-mail, that I would like to exchange the sweatshirt because it is falling apart after a month. They replied to me that since I ordered the sweatshirt in mid-December that it is beyond the 30 day return window for defective merchandise, that I am out of luck.

I usually buy much cheaper sweatshirts for my son and have never had a problem with them even after a year or two. This expensive sweatshirt starts falling apart in a month and they won't do anything about it? If they will not stand behind their products, I will never buy anything from them again.

Updated: The response below is the same as the one I received to my exchange request via e-mail. So basically, Fanatics does not stand behind the products they sell. Any brick & mortar store would exchange a piece of clothing that started falling apart at the seams in a month, but Fanatics will not.",2016-01-26,NA,"Site Jabber",NA
